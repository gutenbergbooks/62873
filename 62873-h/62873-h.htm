<p>The awakened interest in supernormal
phenomena which has taken place in recent
years has included in its wake the absorbing
subject of Vampirism. Yet there has not
been any collection published of vampire
stories which are common to all the five
continents of the globe. The subject of
vampirism is regarded more seriously to-day
than it was even a decade since, and
an attempt has been made in this volume
to supply as far as possible all the instances
which could be collected from the various
countries. How far a certain amount of
scientific truth may underlie even what
may be regarded as the most extravagant
stories must necessarily be, for the present,
at any rate, an open question; but he would
indeed be a bold man who would permit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
his scepticism as to the objective existence
of vampires in the past or the possibility
of vampirism in the future to extend to
a categorical denial. If this collection of
stories helps, even in a slight degree, to the
elucidation of the problem, the book will
not have been written in vain.</p>

<h1>VAMPIRES AND VAMPIRISM</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>What is a vampire? The definition given
in Webster’s <i>International Dictionary</i> is:
“A blood-sucking ghost or re-animated
body of a dead person; a soul or re-animated
body of a dead person believed to
come from the grave and wander about by
night sucking the blood of persons asleep,
causing their death.”</p>

<p>Whitney’s <i>Century Dictionary</i> says that
a vampire is: “A kind of spectral body
which, according to a superstition existing
among the Slavic and other races on the
Lower Danube, leaves the grave during
the night and maintains a semblance of
life by sucking the warm blood of living
men and women while they are asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Dead wizards, werwolves, heretics, and
other outcasts become vampires, as do also
the illegitimate offspring of parents themselves
illegitimate, and anyone killed by
a vampire.”</p>

<p>According to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>:
“The persons who turn vampires are generally
wizards, suicides, and those who come
to a violent end or have been cursed by
their parents or by the Church. But anyone
may become a vampire if an animal
(especially a cat) leaps over the corpse or
a bird flies over it.”</p>

<p>Among the specialists, the writers upon
vampire lore and legend, two definitions
may be quoted:—Hurst, who says that:
“A vampyr is a dead body which continues
to live in the grave; which it leaves, however,
by night, for the purpose of sucking
the blood of the living, whereby it is
nourished and preserved in good condition,
instead of becoming decomposed like other
dead bodies”; and Scoffern, who wrote:
“The best definition I can give of a vampire
is a living mischievous and murderous dead
body. A living dead body! The words
are idle, contradictory, incomprehensible,
but so are vampires.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>“Vampires,” says the learned Zopfius,
“come out of their graves in the night time,
rush upon people sleeping in their beds,
suck out all their blood and destroy them.
They attack men, women, and children,
sparing neither age nor sex. Those who
are under the malignity of their influence
complain of suffocation and a total deficiency
of spirits, after which they soon
expire. Some of them being asked at the
point of death what is the matter with them,
their answer is that such persons lately
dead rise to torment them.”</p>

<p>Not all vampires, however, are, or were,
suckers of blood. Some, according to the
records, despatched their victims by inflicting
upon them contagious diseases, or
strangling them without drawing blood,
or causing their speedy or retarded death
by various other means.</p>

<p>Messrs Skeat and Blagden, in <i>Pagan
Races of the Malay Peninsula</i> (vol. i. p. 473),
state that “a vampire, according to the
view of Sakai of Perak, is not a demon—even
though it is incidentally so-called—but
a being of flesh and blood,” and support
this view by the statement that the vampire
cannot pass through walls and hedges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The word <i>vampire</i> (Dutch, <i>vampyr</i>;
Polish, <i>wampior</i> or <i>upior</i>; Slownik, <i>upir</i>;
Ukraine, <i>upeer</i>) is held by Skeat to be
derived from the Servian <i>wampira</i>. The
Russians, Morlacchians, inhabitants of
Montenegro, Bohemians, Servians, Arnauts,
both of Hydra and Albania, know the
vampire under the name of <i>wukodalak</i>,
<i>vurkulaka</i>, or <i>vrykolaka</i>, a word which
means “wolf-fairy,” and is thought by some
to be derived from the Greek. In Crete,
where Slavonic influence has not been felt,
the vampire is known by the name of
<i>katakhaná</i>. Vampire lore is, in general,
confined to stories of resuscitated corpses
of male human beings, though amongst the
Malays a <i>penangglan</i>, or vampire, is a living
witch, who can be killed if she can be
caught in the act of witchery. She is
especially feared in houses where a birth
has taken place, and it is the custom to
hang up a bunch of thistle in order to catch
her. She is said to keep vinegar at home
to aid her in re-entering her own body. In
the Malay Peninsula, parts of Polynesia and
the neighbouring districts, the vampire is
conceived as a head with entrails attached,
which comes forth to suck the blood of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
living human beings. In Transylvania, the
belief prevails that every person killed by
a <i>nosferatu</i> (vampire) becomes in turn a
vampire, and will continue to suck the blood
of other innocent people until the evil
spirit has been exorcised, either by opening
the grave of the suspected person and
driving a stake through the corpse, or firing
a pistol-shot into the coffin. In very
obstinate cases it is further recommended
to cut off the head, fill the mouth with
garlic, and then replace the head in its proper
place in the coffin; or else to extract the
heart and burn it, and strew the ashes over
the grave.</p>

<p>The <i>murony</i> of the Wallachians not only
sucks blood, but also possesses the power
of assuming a variety of shapes, as, for
instance, those of a cat, dog, flea, or spider;
in consequence of which the ordinary evidence
of death caused by the attack of a
vampire, viz. the mark of a bite in the back
of the neck, is not considered indispensable.
The Wallachians have a very great fear of
sudden death, greater perhaps than any
other people, for they attribute sudden
death to the attack of a vampire, and believe
that anyone destroyed by a vampire must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
become a vampire, and that no power can
save him from this fate. A similar belief
obtains in Northern Albania, where it is
also held that a wandering spirit has power
to enter the body of any individual guilty of
undetected crime, and that such obsession
forms part of his punishment.</p>

<p>Some writers have ascribed the origin
of the belief in vampires to Greek Christianity,
but there are traces of the superstition
and belief at a considerably earlier date than
this. In the opinion of the anthropologist
Tylor, “the shortest way of treating the
belief is to refer it directly to the principles
of savage animism. We shall see that most
of its details fall into their places at once,
and that vampires are not mere creations of
groundless fancy, but causes conceived in
spiritual form to account for specific facts
of wasting disease.” It is more than probable
that the practice of offering up living
animals as sacrifices to satisfy the thirst
of departed human beings, combined with
the ideas of the Platonist and the teachings
of the learned Jew, Isaac Arbanel, who
maintained that before the soul can be
loosed from the fetters of the flesh it must
lie some months with it in the grave, may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
have influenced the belief and assisted its
development. Vampirism found a place
in Babylonian belief and in the folk-lore
and traditions of many countries of the Near
East. The belief was quite common in
Arabia, although there is no trace of it
there in pre-Christian times. The earliest
references to vampires are found in Chaldean
and Assyrian tablets. Later, the pagan
Romans gave their adherence to the belief
that the dead bodies of certain people could
be allured from their graves by sorcerers,
unless the bodies had actually undergone
decomposition, and that the only means of
effectually preventing such “resurrections”
was by cremating the remains. In Grecian
lore there are many wonderful stories of the
dead rising from their graves and feasting
upon the blood of the young and beautiful.
From Greece and Rome the superstition
spread throughout Austria, Hungary, Lorraine,
Poland, Roumania, Iceland, and even
to the British Isles, reaching its height in
the period from 1723 to 1735, when a
vampire fever or epidemic broke out in
the south-east of Europe, particularly in
Hungary and Servia. The belief in vampires
even spread to Africa, where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Kaffirs held that bad men alone live a second
time and try to kill the living by night.
According to a local superstition of the
Lesbians, the unquiet ghost of the Virgin
Gello used to haunt their island, and was
supposed to cause the deaths of young
children.</p>

<p>Various devices have been resorted to
in different countries at the time of burial,
in the belief that the dead could thus be
prevented from returning to earth-life. In
some instances, <i>e.g.</i> among the Wallachians,
a long nail was driven through the skull
of the corpse, and the thorny stem of a wild
rose-bush laid upon the body, in order that
its shroud might become entangled with it,
should it attempt to rise. The Kroats and
Slavonians burned the straw upon which
the suspected body lay. They then locked
up all the cats and dogs, for if these animals
stepped over the corpse it would assuredly
return as a vampire and suck the blood of
the village folk. Many held that to drive
a white thorn stake through the dead body
rendered the vampire harmless, and the
peasants of Bukowina still retain the practice
of driving an ash stake through the
breasts of suicides and supposed vampires—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
practice common in England, so far as
suicides were concerned, until 1823, when
there was passed “An Act to alter and
amend the law relating to the interment of
the remains of any person found <i>felo de se</i>,”
in which it was enacted that the coroner or
other officer “shall give directions for the
private interment of the remains of such
person <i>felo de se</i> without any stake being
driven through the body of such person.”
It was also ordained that the burial was only
to take place between nine and twelve
o’clock at night.</p>

<p>The driving of a stake through the body
does not seem to have had always the
desired effect. De Schartz, in his <i>Magia
Postuma</i>, published at Olmutz in 1706,
tells of a shepherd in the village of Blow,
near Kadam, in Bohemia, who made several
appearances after his death and called
certain persons, who never failed to die
within eight days of such call. The peasants
of Blow took up the body and fixed it to
the ground by means of a stake driven
through the corpse. The man, when in
that condition, told them that they were
very good to give him a stick with which
he could defend himself against the dogs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
which worried him. Notwithstanding the
stake, he got up again that same night,
alarmed many people, and, presumably
out of revenge, strangled more people in that
one night than he had ever done on a single
occasion before. It was decided to hand
over his body to the public executioner,
who was ordered to see that the remains
were burned outside the village. When
the executioner and his assistants attempted
to move the corpse for that purpose, it
howled like a madman, and moved its feet
and hands as though it were alive. They
then pierced the body through with stakes,
but he again uttered loud cries and a great
quantity of bright vermilion blood flowed
from him. The cremation, however, put
an end to the apparition and haunting of
the spectre. De Schartz says that the
only remedy for these apparitions is to cut
off the heads and burn the bodies of those
who come back to haunt their former
abodes. It was, however, customary to
hold a public inquiry and examination of
witnesses before proceeding to the burning
of a body, and if, upon examination of
the body, it was found that the corpse had
begun to decompose, that the limbs were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
not supple and mobile, and the blood not
fluidic, then burning was not commanded.
Even in the case of suspected persons an
interval of six to seven weeks was always
allowed to lapse before the grave was opened
in order to ascertain whether the flesh had
decayed and the limbs lost their suppleness
and mobility. A Strigon or Indian vampire,
who was transfixed with a sharp thorn
cudgel, near Larbach, in 1672, pulled it
out of his body and flung it back contemptuously.</p>

<p>Bartholin, in <i>de Causa contemptûs mortis</i>,
tells the story of a man, named Harpye,
who ordered his wife to bury him exactly
at the kitchen door, in order that he might
see what went on in the house. The
woman executed her commission, and soon
after his death he appeared to several
people in the neighbourhood, killed people
while they were engaged in their occupations,
and played so many mischievous
pranks that the inhabitants began to move
away from the village. At last a man named
Olaus Pa took courage and ran at the spectre
with a lance, which he drove into the
apparition. The spectre instantly vanished,
taking the spear with it. Next morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Olaus had the grave of Harpye opened,
when he found the lance in the dead body,
which had not become corrupted. The
corpse was then taken from the grave,
burned, and the ashes thrown into the sea,
and the spectre did not afterwards trouble
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>To cross the arms of the corpse, or to
place a cross or crucifix upon the grave,
or to bury a suspected corpse at the junction
of four cross-roads, was, in some parts,
regarded as an efficacious preventive of
vampirism. It will be remembered that
it was at one time the practice in England
to bury suicides at the four cross-roads.
If a vampire should make its appearance,
it could be prevented from ever
appearing again by forcing it to take the
oath not to do so, if the words “by my
winding-sheet” were incorporated in the
oath.</p>

<p>One charm employed by the Wallachians
to prevent a person becoming a vampire
was to rub the body in certain parts with
the lard of a pig killed on St Ignatius’s
Day.</p>

<p>In Poland and Russia, vampires make
their appearance from noon to midnight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
instead of between nightfall and dawn, the
rule that generally prevails. They come
and suck the blood of living men and
animals in such abundance that sometimes
it flows from them at the nose and
ears, and occasionally in such profusion
that the corpse swims in the blood thus
oozing from it as it lies in the coffin. One
may become immune from the attacks of
vampires by mixing this blood with flour
and making bread from the mixture, a
portion of which must be eaten; otherwise
the charm will not work. The Californians
held that the mere breaking of
the spine of the corpse was sufficient to
prevent its return as a vampire. Sometimes
heavy stones were piled on the grave
to keep the ghost within, a practice to
which Frazer traces the origin of funeral
cairns and tombstones. Two resolutions
of the Sorbonne, passed between 1700 and
1710, prohibited the cutting off of the heads
and the maiming of the bodies of persons
supposed to be vampires.</p>

<p>In the German folk-tale known as
<i>Faithful John</i>, the statue said to the king:
“If you, with your own hand, cut off the
heads of both your children and sprinkle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
me with their blood, I shall be brought to
life again.” According to primitive ideas,
blood is life, and to receive blood is to
receive life: the soul of the dead wants
to live, and, consequently, loves blood.
The shades in Hades are eager to drink the
blood of Odysseus’s sacrifice, that their
life may be renewed for a time. It is of
the greatest importance that the soul should
get what it desires, as, if not satisfied, it
might come and attack the living. It is
possible that the bodily mutilations which
to this day accompany funerals among
some peoples have their origin in the belief
that the departed spirit is refreshed by the
blood thus spilt. The Samoans called it
an “offering of blood” for the dead when
the mourners beat their heads till the
blood ran.</p>

<p>The Australian native sorcerers are said
to acquire their magical influence by eating
human flesh, but this is done once only in
a lifetime. According to Nider’s <i>Formicarius</i>,
part of the ceremony of initiation
into wizardry and witchcraft consisted in
drinking in a church, before the commencement
of Mass, from a flask filled with blood
taken from the corpses of murdered infants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The methods employed for the detection
of vampires have varied according to the
countries in which the belief in their existence
was maintained. In some places it
was held that, if there were discovered in
a grave two or three or more holes about
the size of a man’s finger, it would almost
certainly follow that a body with all the
marks of vampirism would be discovered
within the grave. The Wallachians employed
a rather elaborate method of divination.
They were in the habit of choosing
a boy young enough to make it certain
that he was innocent of any impurity.
He was then placed on an absolutely black
and unmutilated horse which had never
stumbled. The horse was then made to
ride about the cemetery and pass over all
the graves. If the horse refused to pass
over any grave, even in spite of repeated
blows, that grave was believed to shelter a
vampire. Their records state that when
such a grave was opened it was generally
found to contain a corpse as fat and handsome
as that of a full-blooded man quietly
sleeping. The finest vermilion blood would
flow from the throat when cut, and this
was held to be the blood he had sucked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
from the veins of living people. It is said
that the attacks of the vampire generally
ceased on this being done.</p>

<p>In the town of Perlepe, between Monastru
and Kiuprili, there existed the extraordinary
phenomenon of a number of families who
were regarded as being the offspring of
<i>vrykolakas</i>, and as possessing the power of
laying the wandering spirits to which they
were related. They are said to have kept
their art very dark and to have practised
it in secret, but their fame was so widely
spread that persons in need of such deliverance
were accustomed to send for them
from other cities. In ordinary life and
intercourse they were avoided by all the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Although some writers have contended
that no vampire has yet been caught in
the act of vampirism, and that, as no
museum of natural history has secured a
specimen, the whole of the stories concerning
vampires may be regarded as mythical,
others have held firmly to a belief in their
existence and inimical power. Dr Pierart,
in <i>La Revue Spiritualiste</i> (vol. iv. p. 104),
wrote: “After a crowd of facts of vampirism
so often proved, shall we say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
there are no more to be had, and that these
never had a foundation? Nothing comes
of nothing. Every belief, every custom,
springs from facts and causes which give
it birth. If one had never seen appear
in the bosom of their families, in various
countries, beings clothed in the appearance
of departed ones known to them, sucking
the blood of one or more persons, and if
the deaths of the victims had not followed
after such apparitions, the disinterment of
corpses would not have taken place, and
there would never have been the attestation
of the otherwise incredible fact
of persons buried for several years being
found with the body soft and flexible, the
eyes wide open, the complexion rosy, the
mouth and nose full of blood, and the blood
flowing fully when the body was struck or
wounded or the head cut off.”</p>

<p>Bishop d’Avranches Huet wrote: “I
will not examine whether the facts of
vampirism, which are constantly being
reported, are true, or the fruit of a
popular error; but it is beyond doubt
that they are testified to by so many
able and trustworthy authors, and by
so many <i>eye-witnesses</i>, that no one ought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
to decide the question without a good deal
of caution.”</p>

<p>Dr Pierart gave the following explanation
of their existence: “Poor, dead
cataleptics, buried as if really dead in cold
and dry spots where morbid causes are incapable
of effecting the destruction of their
bodies, the astral spirit, enveloping itself
with a fluidic ethereal body, is prompted
to quit the precincts of its tomb and to
exercise on living bodies acts peculiar to
physical life, especially that of nutrition,
the result of which, by a mysterious link
between soul and body which spiritualistic
science will some day explain, is forwarded
to the material body lying still within its
tomb, and the latter is thus helped to perpetuate
its vital existence.”</p>

<p>Apart from the spectre vampire there is,
of course, the vampire bat in the world
of natural history, which is said to suck
blood from a sleeping person, insinuating
its tongue into a vein, but without inflicting
pain. Captain Steadman, during his
expedition to Surinam, awoke early one
morning and was alarmed to find his
hammock steeped almost through and himself
weltering in blood, although he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
without pain. It was discovered that he
had been bitten by a vampire bat. Pennant
says that in some parts of America they
destroyed all the cattle introduced by the
missionaries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">EXCOMMUNICATION AND ITS POWER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Greek Church at one time taught that
the bodies of persons upon whom the ban
of excommunication had been passed did
not undergo decomposition after death
until such sentence had been revoked by
the pronouncement of absolution over the
remains, and that, while the bodies remained
in this uncorrupted condition, the
spirits of the individuals wandered up and
down the earth seeking sustenance from
the blood of the living. The non-corruption
of a body, however, was also held to
be one of the proofs of sanctity; but, in
this case, the body preserved its natural
colour and gave an agreeable odour, whereas
the bodies of the excommunicated generally
turned black, swelled out like a drum,
and emitted an offensive smell. Very frequently,
however, when the graves of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
suspected vampires were opened, the faces
were found to be of ruddy complexion
and the veins distended with blood, which,
when opened with a lancet, yielded a supply
of blood as plentiful, fresh, and free as that
found in the veins of young and healthy
living human beings. For many centuries
in the history of Greek Christianity there
was scarcely a village that had not its own
local vampire stories which were related by
the inhabitants and vouched for by them
as having either occurred within their own
knowledge or been related to them by their
parents or relatives as having come within
their personal observation or been verified
by them.</p>

<p>The bodies of murderers and suicides
were also held to be exempt from the law
of dissolution of the mortal remains until
the Church granted release from the curse
entailed upon them by such act. The
priests, by this assumption of power over
the body as well as over the soul, made
profitable use of this superstitious belief
by preying upon the fears and credulity
of the living. They also included in this
ecclesiastical law of exemption from corruption
after death those who in their lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
had been guilty of heinous sins, those who
had tampered with the magic arts, and all
who had been cursed during life by their
parents. These were all said to become
vampires. This belief spread to other
branches of the Christian Church, and the
story is related that St Libentius, Archbishop
of Bremen, who died 4th January
1013, once excommunicated a gang of
pirates, one of whom died shortly afterwards
and was buried in Norway. Seventy
years afterwards his body was found quite
entire and uncorrupted, nor did it fall to
ashes until it had received absolution from
the Bishop Alvareda.</p>

<p>Leo Allatius, a Roman Catholic, describes
a corpse which he found in an undecomposed
condition. He implies that
the Greeks connected the circumstance
with the power invested in them by the
text: “Whatsoever thou shalt bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven,” and by
which they hold that the soul is excluded
from all hope of participation in future
bliss so long as the body remains undecomposed.
Poqueville, another writer, also
states that whenever a bishop or priest
excommunicated a person he added to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
general sentence of excommunication the
words: “After death, let not thy body
have power to dissolve.”</p>

<p>A manuscript was discovered many years
ago in the Church of St Sophia at Thessalonica,
which is an interesting commentary
upon the power claimed by the Church
over excommunicated bodies. The manuscript
states that:</p>

<p>(1) Whoever has been laid under any curse
or received any injunction from his deceased
parents that he has not fulfilled, after his
death the forepart of his body remains entire;</p>

<p>(2) Whoever has been the object of any
anathema appears yellow after death, and
the fingers are shrivelled;</p>

<p>(3) Whoever appears white has been excommunicated
by the divine laws;</p>

<p>(4) Whoever appears black has been excommunicated
by a bishop.</p>

<p>It was held possible to discover, by
means of these signs, the crime for which,
as well as the person on whom, the judgment
had been pronounced. One horrible
result of this ghastly superstition was the
custom which was at one time prevalent
among the Greeks of Salonica, as well as
the Bulgarians in the centre of European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Turkey, and other nations, of disinterring
indiscriminately the bodies of the dead
after they had been buried for twelve
months, in order to ascertain from the condition
of the remains whether the souls
were in heaven or hell, or perambulating
the neighbourhood as vampires.</p>

<p>This assumed ecclesiastical power acted
occasionally, however, injuriously on the
clergy themselves. There is on record one
instance where a priest was killed in revenge
for the death of a man whose illness was
attributed to the sentence of excommunication
that had been passed upon him. On
another occasion a bishop of some diocese
in Morea was robbed by a band of brigands
as he was passing through a portion of the
Maniate territory. When the deed was
done the mountaineers bethought themselves
that the bishop would, in all probability,
excommunicate them as soon as
he reached a place of safety. They saw no
means of averting this, to them, dreadful
calamity, except by the committal of a
further and more heinous crime; and so
they set out in pursuit of the unfortunate
bishop, whom they eventually overtook and
murdered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Many years ago a Greek of Keramia
complained to the Pasha of Khania that the
papás of his village had excommunicated
him and so been the indirect cause of his
having been bewitched. The Pasha sent
for the priest, threw him into prison, and
only released him upon payment of a fine
of 300 piastres.</p>

<p>During a local war a native of Theriso
was taken ill: the cry went up: “It is an
aphorismos.” The papás was accused, reviled,
and threatened with murder unless
the curse was removed; but the man
continued to get worse, and eventually
died. So firm was the belief of everyone
in the neighbourhood that the ban had
caused the man’s death that some of his
companions regarded it as a duty to avenge
his fate, and, in consequence, they sought
out the priest and shot him.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century
the Metropolitan of Larissa was informed
that a papás had disinterred two bodies
and thrown them into the Haliæmon on
pretence of their being vrukólakas. Upon
being summoned before the bishop the priest
admitted the truth of the accusation, and
justified his act by saying that a report had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
been current that a large animal, accompanied
with flames, had been seen to issue
from the grave in which these two bodies
had been buried. The bishop fined the
priest 250 piastres, and sent a proclamation
throughout the diocese that, in future,
similar offences would be punished with
double that fine and be accompanied with
loss of position.</p>

<p>Martin Crusius tells the following curious
story. There were about the court of
Mahomet II. a number of men learned in
Greek and Arabic literature, who had investigated
a variety of points connected
with the Christian faith. They informed
the Sultan that the bodies of persons
excommunicated by the Greek clergy did
not decompose, and when he inquired
whether the effect of absolution was to
dissolve them, he was answered in the
affirmative. Upon this, he sent orders to
Maximus, the Patriarch of that period, to
produce a case by which the truth of the
statement might be tested. The Patriarch
convened his clergy in great trepidation,
and after long deliberation they ascertained
that a woman had been excommunicated
by the previous Patriarch for the commission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of grievous sins. They ascertained the
whereabouts of her grave, and when they
had opened it they found that the corpse
was entire, but swollen out like a drum.
When the news of this reached the Sultan,
he despatched some of his officers to possess
themselves of the body, which they did,
and deposited it in a safe place. On an
appointed day the liturgy was said over
it and the Patriarch recited the absolution
in the presence of the officials. As this was
being done—wonderful to relate!—the bones
were heard to rattle as they fell apart in the
coffin, and at the same time, the narrator
adds, the woman’s soul was also freed from
the punishment to which it had been condemned.
The courtiers at once ran and
informed the Sultan, who was astonished at
the miracle, and exclaimed: “Of a surety
the Christian religion is true.” Calmet
also relates this story, and adds that the
body was found to be entirely black and
much swollen; that it was placed in a
chest under the Emperor’s seal, which chest
was not opened until three days after the
absolution had been pronounced, when the
body was seen to be reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>During the long war between the Christians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
and Mohammedans in the island of
Crete, it became a matter of astonishment
that ravages caused by vampires were no
longer the subject of conversation. “How
can it be, when the number of deaths is so
great, that none of those that die become
katakhanás?” was the question asked,
to be met with the answer: “No one ever
becomes a katakhaná if he dies in time
of war.”</p>

<p>Leo Allatius also relates that he was told
by Athanasius, Metropolitan of Imbros,
that, on one occasion, being earnestly
entreated to pronounce the absolution over
a number of corpses that had long remained
undecomposed, he consented to do so, and
before the recitation was concluded they all
fell away into ashes.</p>

<p>Rycaut relates a similar occurrence, to
which he appends the following remark:
“This story I should not have judged
worth relating, but that I heard it from the
mouth of a grave person who says that his
own eyes were witnesses thereof.”</p>

<p>The Hydhræans (or Hydhrioks) say there
used to be a great number of vampires in
Hydhra, and that their present freedom
is to be attributed solely to the exertions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of their bishop, who banished them all to
Santoréhe, where, on the desert isle, they
now exist in great numbers, wandering
about, rolling stones down the slope towards
the sea, “as may be heard by anyone who
passes near, in a kaík, during the night.”</p>

<p>At the second Council of Limoges, held in
1031, the Bishop of Cahors made the following
statement: “A knight of my diocese
being killed in a state of excommunication,
I refused to comply with the request
of his friends, who solicited me earnestly
to give him absolution. My resolution
was to make an example of him, in order to
strike terror into others. Notwithstanding
this, he was buried in a church dedicated to
St Peter by some soldiers or knights without
any ecclesiastical ceremony, without any
leave, and without the assistance of any
priest. The next morning his body was
found out of the grave, perfectly entire, and
without any token of its having been
touched. The soldiers who buried him
opened the grave and found nothing but
the linen which had been wrapped about
his body. They then buried him afresh
and covered the grave with an enormous
quantity of earth and stones. The next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
day the corpse was found out of the grave
again, and there were no symptoms of anyone
having been at work. The same thing
was repeated five times, and at last they
buried him in unconsecrated ground, at a
distance from the churchyard, when no
further incident occurred.”</p>

<p>Rycaut states that the following story
was related to him with many asseverations
of truth by a grave <i>Candive Kalois</i> called
Sofronio, a preacher, and a person of no
mean repute and learning at Smyrna.</p>

<p>“I knew,” he said, “a certain person
who, for some misdemeanours committed
in the Morea, fled over to the Isle of Milo,
where, though he escaped the hand of
justice, he could not avoid the sentence
of excommunication, from which he could
no more fly than from the conviction of
his own conscience, or the guilt which ever
attended him; for the fatal hour of his
death being come, and the sentence of the
Church not revoked, the body was carelessly
and without solemnity interred in some
retired and unfrequented place. In the
meantime the relatives of the deceased
were much afflicted and anxious for the
sad estate of their dead friend, whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
peasants and islanders were every night
affrighted and disturbed with strange and
unusual apparitions, which they immediately
concluded arose from the grave of the
accursed excommunicant, which, according
to their custom, they immediately opened,
when they found the body uncorrupted,
ruddy, and the veins replete with blood.
The coffin was furnished with grapes,
apples, and nuts, and such fruits as the
season afforded. Whereupon, consultation
being taken, the Kaloires resolved to make
use of the common remedy in those cases,
which was to cut and dismember the body
into several parts and to boil it in wine, as
the approved means of dislodging the evil
spirit and disposing the body to a dissolution.
But the friends of the deceased,
being willing and desirous that the corpse
should rest in peace and some ease given
to the departed soul, obtained a reprieve
from the clergy, and hoped that for a sum
of money (they being persons of a competent
estate) a release might be purchased from
the excommunication under the hand of
the Patriarch. In this manner the corpse
was for a little while freed from dissection,
and letters thereupon sent to Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
with this direction, That in case
the Patriarch should condescend to take
off the excommunication, that the day,
hour, and minute that he signed the remission
should be inserted in the document.
And now the corpse was taken into the
church (the country people not being willing
it should remain in the field), and prayers
and masses were daily said for its dissolution
and the pardon of the offender; when one
day, after many prayers, supplications, and
offerings (as this Sofrino attested to me
with many protestations), and whilst he
himself was heard performing divine service,
on a sudden was heard a rumbling noise in
the coffin of the dead party, to the fear and
astonishment of all persons then present;
which when they had opened they found the
body consumed and dissolved as far into
its first principles of earth as if it had
been several years interred. The hour and
minute of this dissolution was immediately
noted and precisely observed, which being
compared with the date of the Patriarch’s
release when it was signed at Constantinople,
it was found exactly to agree with that
moment in which the body returned to its
ashes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>In most countries the vampire was regarded
as a night-wanderer, but resting in
its grave on Friday night, so that the ceremony
of absolution had to be performed on
that night or during Saturday, because, if
the spirit was out on its rambles when the
ceremony took place, it was unavailing.</p>

<p>The Sfakians generally believe that the
ravages committed by these night-wanderers
used in former times to be far more
frequent than they are at the present day,
and that they have become comparatively
rare solely in consequence of the increased
zeal and skill possessed by members of the
sacerdotal order.</p>

<p>Tournefort relates an entertaining story
of a vampire that woefully annoyed the
inhabitants of Myconi. Prayers, processions,
stabbing with swords, sprinklings of
holy water, and even pouring the latter
in large quantities down the throat of the
refractory <i>vroucolaca</i> were all tried in vain.
An Albanian who chanced to be at Myconi
objected to two of these remedies. It was
no wonder the devil continued in, he said,
for how could he possibly come through the
holy water? And as to swords, they
were equally effectual in preventing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
exit, for their handles being crosses, he was
so much terrified that he dare not pass
them. To obviate the latter objection, he
recommended that Turkish scymetars
should be used. The scymetars were
accordingly put in requisition, but the pertinacious
devil still retained his hold of the
corpse and played his pranks with as much
vigour as ever. At length, when all the
respectable inhabitants were packing up to
take flight to Syra or Tinos, an effectual
method of ousting the <i>vroucolaca</i> was
fortunately suggested. The body was committed
to the flames on January 1st, 1701,
and the spirit being thus forcibly ejected
from its abode, was rendered incapable of
doing further mischief.</p>

<p>There is a story told of St Stanislaus
raising to life a man who had been dead for
three years, whom he called to life in order
that he might give evidence on the saint’s
behalf in a court of justice. After having
given his evidence, the resuscitated man
returned quietly to his grave.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE VAMPIRE IN BABYLONIA, ASSYRIA, AND GREECE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The belief in the vampire and ghoul was prevalent
even in Babylon and Assyria, where it
was maintained that the dead could appear
again upon earth and seek sustenance
from the living. The belief is, in all probability,
linked up with the almost universal
theory that transfused blood is necessary
for revivification. Baths of human blood
were anciently prescribed as a possible
remedy for leprosy.</p>

<p>Mr R. Campbell Thompson, in his work
<i>The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia</i>,
states that the <i>Ekimmu</i> or departed spirit
was the soul of the dead person unable to
rest, which wandered as a spectre over the
earth. “If it found a luckless man who
had wandered far from his fellows into
haunted places, it fastened upon him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
plaguing and tormenting him until such
time as a priest should drive it away with
exorcisms.”</p>

<p>Mr Thompson also gives the translation of
the following two tablets, which, it will be
seen, contain references to this belief:—</p>

<p>Greek Christianity, as already stated,
has been credited by many with the origin
of the vampire belief, but this contention
is hardly borne out by facts. The belief
was undoubtedly developed greatly under
the influence of the Greek Church, and
utilised by the Greek priests as an additional
power which they possessed over the
people. It did not become prominent in
Greece until after the establishment of
Christianity, and there are many remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
stories told of vampire apparitions among
the Slavonic races bordering on Greece, as
well as among the Arabians. In later
times, Father Richard, a French Jesuit of
the seventeenth century, went as a missionary
to the Archipelago, and has left an
account of the islands of Santerini in which
he discourses at length upon the <i>bucolacs</i>
or vampires of that district.</p>

<p>Some Greeks believe that the spectre
which appears is not really the soul of the
deceased, but an evil spirit which enters
his body after the soul of the owner has
been withdrawn. Thus Leo Allatius, in
describing the belief, says: “The corpse
is entered by a demon which is the source
of ruin to unhappy men. For frequently
emerging from the tomb in the form of that
body and roaming about the city and other
inhabited places, especially by night it
betakes itself to any house it fancies, and,
after knocking at the door, addresses one of
the inmates in a loud tone. If the person
answers he is done for: two days after that
he dies. If he does not answer he is safe.
In consequence of this, all the people in
Chios, if anyone calls to them by night,
never reply the first time; for if a second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
call is given they know that it does not
proceed from the <i>vrykolaka</i> but from someone
else.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Menées des Grecs</i> it is recorded that
an ecclesiastic of Scheti, being excommunicated
by his superior for some act of disobedience,
quitted the desert and came to
Alexandria, where he was apprehended by
the governor of the city, stripped of his
religious habit, and strongly solicited to
sacrifice to the idols of the place. The man
bravely resisted the temptation, and was
tortured in several ways, till at last they
cut off his head, and threw his body out of
the city to be devoured by dogs. The next
night it was carried away by the Christians,
who, having embalmed it and wrapped it
up in fine linen, interred it in an honourable
part of the church with all the respect due
to the remains of a martyr. But at the
next celebration of the Mass, upon the
deacons crying out aloud as usual, “Let
the catechumens and all who do not communicate
retire,” his grave instantly opened
and the martyr retired into the church
porch. When Mass was over he came again
of his own accord into the grave. Not
long afterwards it was revealed by an angel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
to a holy person, who had continued three
days in prayer, that the deceased ecclesiastic
had been excommunicated by his
superior, and would continue bound till that
same superior had reversed the sentence.
Upon this a messenger was despatched to
the desert after the holy anchorite, who
ordered the grave to be opened and absolved
the deceased, who, after this, continued in his
grave in peace.</p>

<p>Pitton de Tournefort, in his <i>Voyage into
the Levant</i>, gives the following interesting
account: “We were present at a very
different scene and one very barbarous at
Myconi. The man, whose story we are
going to relate, was a peasant of Myconi,
naturally ill-natured and quarrelsome; this
is a circumstance to be taken notice of
in such a case: he was murdered in the
fields, nobody knew how or by whom.
Two days after his being buried in a chapel
in the town it was noised about that he was
seen to walk about in the night with great
haste, that he tumbled about other people’s
goods, put out their lamps, gripped them
behind, and played a dozen other monkey
tricks. At first the story was received with
laughter, but the thing was looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
seriously when the better sort of people
began to complain of it: the papás themselves
gave credit to the fact, and no doubt
had their reasons for so doing; masses
were duly said; but for all this the
peasant drove his old trade and heeded
nothing they could do. After divers meetings
of the chief people of the city, of priests
and monks, it was gravely concluded that
it was necessary in consequence of some
musty ceremonial to wait till the ninth day
after the interment should be expired.</p>

<p>“On the tenth day they said one Mass
in the chapel where the body was laid in
order to drive out the demon which they
imagined was got into it. After Mass they
took up his body and got everything ready
for blowing out his heart.... The corpse
stunk so abominably that they were obliged
to burn frankincense, but the smoke mixing
with the exhalations from the carcase
increased the stench; every person averred
that the blood of the corpse was extremely
red. The butcher swore that the body was
still warm....”</p>

<p>Pitton concludes the story by ridiculing
the theory that this was the body of a vampire
or <i>vroucolaca</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>The practice of burning the body of a
suspected or proved vampire does not
appear to have found general favour in
Greece, doubtless by reason of the fact
that the Greeks possessed a religious horror
of burning a body on which holy oil had
been poured by the priest when performing
the last rites upon the dying man.</p>

<p>Leake, whose <i>Travels in Northern Greece</i>
were published in 1835, says in the fourth
volume of that work: “It would be
difficult now to meet with an example of
the most barbarous of all these superstitions,
the Vrukólaka. The name being
Illyric, seems to acquit the Greeks of the
invention, which was probably introduced
into the country by the barbarians of
Sclavonic race. Tournefort’s description is
admitted to be correct. The Devil is supposed
to enter the Vrukólaka, who, rising
from his grave, torments first his nearest
relatives and then others, causing their
death or loss of health. The remedy is to
dig up the body and if, after it has been
exorcised by the priest, the demon still
persists in annoying the living, to cut
it into small pieces, or, if that be not
sufficient, to burn it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>In Crete the belief in vampires—or
katalkanás, as the Cretans call them—and
their existence and ill-deeds forms a
general article of popular belief throughout
the island, but is particularly
strong in the mountains, and if anyone
ventures to doubt it, undeniable
facts are brought forward to silence the
incredulous.</p>

<p>One of the stories told by the Cretans is
as follows: “Once upon a time the village
of Kalikráti, in the district of Sfakia, was
haunted by a Katakhanás, and the people
did not know what man he was or from what
part he came. This Katakhanás destroyed
both children and full-grown men, and
desolated both that village and many others.
They had buried him at the church of
St George at Kalikráti, and in those times
he was regarded as a man of note, and they
had built an arch over his grave. Now a
certain shepherd, believed to be his mutual
Sýnteknos,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was tending his sheep and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
goats near the church, and, on being caught
in a shower, he went to the sepulchre that he
might be protected from the rain. Afterwards
he determined to sleep and pass the
night there, and, after taking off his arms, he
placed them by the stone which served him
as his pillow, crosswise. And people might
say that it was on this account that the
Katakhanás was not permitted to leave
his tomb. During the night, then, as he
wished to go out again, that he might
destroy men, he said to the shepherd:
‘Gossip, get up hence, for I have some
business that requires me to come out.’
The shepherd answered him not, either the
first time, or the second, or the third;
further, he knew that the man had become
a Katakhanás, and that it was he who had
done all those evil deeds. On this account
he said to him on the fourth time of his
speaking: ‘I shall not get up hence,
gossip, for I fear you are no better than you
should be and may do me some mischief;
but if I must get up, swear to me by your
winding-sheet that you will not hurt me,
and on that I will get up.’ And he did not
pronounce the proposed words, but said
other things; nevertheless, when the shepherd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
did not suffer him to get up, he swore to
him as he wished. On this he got up, and,
taking his arms, removed them away from
the monument, and the Katakhanás came
forth, and, after greeting the shepherd, said
to him: ‘Gossip, you must not go away, but
sit down here; for I have some business
which I must go after; but I shall return
within the hour, for I have something
to say to you.’ So the shepherd waited
for him.</p>

<p>“And the Katakhanás went a distance of
about ten miles, where there was a couple recently
married, and he destroyed them. On
his return the gossip saw that he was carrying
some liver, his hands being moistened
with blood; and, as he carried it, he blew
into it, just as the butcher does, to increase
the size of the liver. And he showed his
gossip that it was cooked, as if it had been
done on the fire. After this he said:
‘Let us sit down, gossip, that we may
eat.’ And the shepherd pretended to eat
it, but only swallowed dry bread, and kept
dropping the liver into his bosom. Therefore,
when the hour for their separation
arrived, the Katakhanás said to the shepherd:
‘Gossip, this which you have seen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
you must not mention, for if you do, my
twenty nails will be fixed in your children
and yourself.’ Yet the shepherd lost no
time, but gave information to the priests
and others, and they went to the tomb,
and there they found the Katakhanás, just
as he had been buried. And all people
became satisfied that it was he who had
done all the evil deeds. On this account
they collected a great deal of wood, and they
cast him on it, and burnt him. His gossip
was not present, but when the Katakhanás
was already half-consumed, he, too, came
forward in order that he might enjoy the
ceremony. And the Katakhanás cast, as
it were, a single spot of blood, and it fell on
his foot, which wasted away, as if it had
been roasted on a fire. On this account
they sifted even the ashes, and found the
little finger nail of the Katakhanás unburnt,
and burnt it too.”</p>

<p>William of Newbury, who flourished
about the middle of the twelfth century,
relates that in his time a man appeared
corporeally in the county of Buckingham
for three nights together, to his wife and,
afterwards, to his other relatives. The
way they took to defend themselves against
his frightful visits was to stay up all night
and make a noise when they observed that
he was coming. Upon this he appeared
to several people in broad day. Hereupon
the Bishop of Lincoln summoned his council,
and was informed that the thing was common
in England, and that the only way to
stop it which they knew of was to burn
the spectre. The bishop did not relish
this advice, as he thought the expedient
a cruel one; but he wrote out a form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
absolution on a scrap of paper and ordered
it to be laid on the body of the deceased,
which was found to be as fresh and entire
as if it had been dead only a day; and from
that time the apparition was no more heard
of. The author adds that these stories
would be thought incredible if several instances
of them had not happened in his
time, attested by persons of undoubted
credit.</p>

<p>The same author mentions a similar
story, the <i>locale</i> of which was Berwick-on-Tweed,
where the body was cut in pieces
and burnt. Another vampire was burnt
at Melrose Abbey. It was that of a very
worldly priest who had been in his lifetime
so fond of hunting that he was commonly
called a <i>hundeprest</i>. A still more remarkable
case occurred at a castle in the north
of England, where the vampire so frightened
all the people that no one ever ventured
out of doors between sunset and sunrise.
The sons of one of his supposed victims at
length opened his grave and pierced his
body, from which a great quantity of blood
immediately flowed, which plainly proved
that a large number of persons had been
his victims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>At Waterford, in Ireland, there is a little
graveyard under a ruined church near
Strongbow’s Tower. Legend has it that
underneath the ground at this spot there
lies a beautiful female vampire still ready
to kill those she can lure thither by her
beauty.</p>

<p>A vampire story is also related concerning
an old Cumberland farmhouse, the
victim being a girl whose screams were
heard as she was bitten, and who only
escaped with her life by thus screaming.
In this case the monster was tracked to a
vault in the churchyard, where forty or
fifty coffins were found open, their contents
mutilated and scattered around. One
coffin only was untouched, and on the lid
being taken off the form was recognised as
being that of the apparition which had been
seen, and the body was accordingly burnt,
when the manifestations ceased.</p>

<p>In vol. iii. of <i>Borderland</i> Dr Franz Hartmann
gave particulars of some vampire
cases which had come under his observation.</p>

<p>“A young lady of G—— had an admirer,
who asked her in marriage; but as he was
a drunkard she refused and married another.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Thereupon the lover shot himself, and
soon after that event a vampire, assuming
his form, visited her frequently at night,
especially when her husband was absent.
She could not see him, but felt his presence
in a way that could leave no room for doubt.
The medical faculty did not know what
to make of the case; they called it ‘hysterics,’
and tried in vain every remedy
in the pharmacopœia, until she at last had
the spirit exorcised by a man of strong
faith.”</p>

<p>Another case is that of a miller at D——
who had a healthy servant boy, who soon
after entering his service began to fail in
health. He had a ravenous appetite, but
nevertheless grew daily more feeble. Being
interrogated, he at last confessed that a
thing which he could not see, but which
he could plainly feel, came to him every
night and sat upon his stomach, drawing
all the life out of him, so that he became
paralysed for the time being and could
neither move nor cry out. Thereupon the
miller agreed to share the bed with the boy,
and proposed to him that he should give
him a certain sign when the vampire
arrived. This was done, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
sign was given the miller grasped the invisible
but very tangible substance that
rested upon the boy’s stomach, and although
it struggled to escape, he grasped it firmly
and threw it into the fire. After that the
boy recovered his health and there was no
repetition of the vampire’s visits.</p>

<p>Dr Hartmann adds to this last account:
“Those who, like myself, have on innumerable
occasions removed astral tumours
and thereby cured physical tumours will
find the above not incredible nor inexplicable.
Moreover, the above accounts do not
refer to events of the past, but to persons
still living in this country.”</p>

<p>The following account is taken from the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> of July 1851:—</p>

<h3>“<i>Singular Instance of Superstition</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1629</h3>

<p>“The Case, or, rather, History of a Case
that happened in the County of Hereford
in the fourth Year of the Reign of King
Charles the First, which was taken from a
MS. of Serjeant Mainard, who writes thus:</p>

<p>“‘I write the evidence which was given,
which I and many others heard, and I write
it exactly according to what was deposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
at the Trial at the Bar in the King’s Bench.
Johan Norkot, the wife of Arthur Norkot,
being murdered, the question arose how she
came by her death. The coroner’s inquest
on view of the body and deposition of Mary
Norkot, John Okeman and Agnes, his wife,
inclined to find Joan Norkot <i>felo de se</i>: for
they (<i>i.e.</i> the witnesses before mentioned)
informed the coroner and the jury that she
was found dead in the bed and her throat
cut, the knife sticking in the floor of the
room; that the night before she was so
found she went to bed with her child (now
plaintiff in this appeal), her husband being
absent, and that no other person after such
time as she was gone to bed came into the
house, the examinants lying in the outer
room, and they must needs have seen if
any stranger had come in. Whereupon the
jury gave up to the coroner their verdict
that she was <i>felo de se</i>. But afterwards
upon rumour in the neighbourhood, and the
observation of divers circumstances that
manifested she did not, nor according to
these circumstances, possibly could, murder
herself, thereupon the jury, whose verdict
was not drawn into form by the coroner,
desired the coroner that the body which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
was buried might be taken up out of the
grave, which the coroner assented to, and
thirty days after her death she was taken
up, in the presence of the jury and a great
number of the people, whereupon the jury
changed their verdict. The persons being
tried at Hertford Assizes were acquitted,
but so much against the evidence that the
judge (Harvy) let fall his opinion that it
were better an appeal were brought than
so foul a murder should escape unpunished.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Anno, paschæ termino, quarto Caroli</i>,
they were tried on the appeal which was
brought by the young child against his
father, the grandfather and aunt, and her
husband Okeman. And because the evidence
was so strange I took exact and particular
notes of it, which was as followeth,
of the matters above mentioned and related,
an ancient and grave person, the minister
of the parish where the fact was committed,
being sworn to give evidence according to
custom, deposed, that the body being taken
out of the grave thirty days after the
party’s death and lying on the grave and
the four defendants present, they were required
each of them to touch the dead body.
O.’s wife fell on her knees and prayed God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
to show token of their innocency, or to
some such purpose, but her very words I
forget. The appellers did touch the dead
body, whereupon the brow of the dead,
which was all a livid or carrion colour (that
was the verbal expression in the terms of
the witness) began to have a dew or gentle
sweat, which reached down in drops on the
face, and the brow turned and changed to
a lively and fresh colour, and the dead
opened one of her eyes and shut it again,
and this opening the eye was done three
several times. She likewise thrust out the
ring or marriage finger three times and
pulled it in again, and the finger dropt
blood from it on the grass.</p>

<p>“‘Hyde (Nicholas), Chief Justice, seeming
to doubt the evidence, asked the
witness: “Who saw this beside yourself?”</p>

<p>“‘Witness: “I cannot swear that others
saw it; but, my lord,” said he, “I believe
the whole company saw it, and if it had
been thought a doubt, proof would have
been made of it, and many would have
attested with me.”</p>

<p>“‘Then the witness observing some admiration
in the auditors, he spoke further,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
“My lord, I am minister of the parish, long
knew all the parties, but never had any
occasion of displeasure against any of
them, nor had to do with them, or they
with me, but as their minister. The thing
was wonderful to me, but I have no interest
in the matter, but am called upon to testify
the truth and that I have done.”</p>

<p>“‘This witness was a reverend person
as I guess about seventy years of age.
His testimony was delivered gravely and
temperately, but to the good admiration
of the auditor. Whereupon, applying himself
to the Lord Chief Justice, he said, “My
lord, my brother here present is minister
of the next parish adjacent, and I am
assured saw all done as I have affirmed,”
whereupon that person was also sworn to
give evidence, and he deposed the same in
every point, viz., the sweat of the brow,
the changes of its colour, the opening of
the eye, the thrice motion of the finger and
drawing it in again; only the first witness
deposed that a man dipped his finger in the
blood to examine it, and swore he believed
it was real blood. I conferred afterwards
with Sir Edmund Vowel, barrister at law,
and others who concurred in this observation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and for myself, if I were upon my
oath, can depose that these depositions,
especially of the first witness, are truly
here reported in substance.</p>

<p>“‘The other evidence was given against
the prisoners, viz., against the grandmother
of the plaintiff and against Okeman and
his wife, that they lay in the next room to
the dead person that night, and that none
came into the house till they found her
dead next morning, therefore if she did not
murther herself, they must be the murtherers,
and to that end further proof was
made. First she lay in a composed manner
in her bed, the bed cloaths nothing at all
disturbed, and her child by her in the bed.
Secondly, her throat was cut from ear to
ear and her neck broken, and if she first
cut her throat, she could not break her
neck in the bed, nor <i>e contra</i>. Thirdly,
there was no blood in the bed, saving that
there was a tincture of blood upon the
bolster whereupon her head lay, but no
other substance of blood at all. Fourthly,
from the bed’s head on there was a stream
of blood on the floor, till it ponded on the
bending of the floor to a very great quantity
and there was also another stream<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
of blood on the floor at the bed’s feet,
which ponded also on the floor to another
great quantity but no other communication
of blood on either of these places, the
one from the other, neither upon the bed,
so that she bled in two places severely, and
it was deposed that turning up the matte
of the bed, there were clotes of congealed
blood in the straw of the matte underneath.
Fifthly, the bloody knife in the morning
was found clinging in the floor a good distance
from the bed, but the point of the
knife as it stuck in the floor was towards
the bed and the haft towards the door.
Sixthly, lastly, there was the brand of a
thumb and four fingers of a left hand on the
dead person’s left hand.</p>

<p>“‘Hyde, Chief Justice: “How can you
know the print of a left hand from the print
of a right hand in such a case?”</p>

<p>“‘Witness: “My lord, it is hard to
describe it, but if it please the honourable
judge (<i>i.e.</i> the judge sitting on the bench
beside the Chief Justice) to put his left
hand on your left hand, you cannot possibly
place your right hand in the same
posture.”</p>

<p>“‘It being done, and appearing so, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
defendants had time to make their defence,
but gave no evidence to that purpose.</p>

<p>“‘The jury departing from the bar and
returning, acquitted Okeman and found the
other three guilty; who, being severally
demanded why judgment should not be
pronounced, sayd nothing, but each of
them said, “I did not do it.” “I did not
do it.” Judgment was made and the
grandmother and the husband executed,
but the aunt had the privilege to be spared
execution, being with child. I enquired
if they confessed anything at execution,
but did not as I was told.’</p>

<p>“Thus far the serjeant, afterwards Sir
John Mainard, a person of great note and
judgment in the law. The paper, of which
this is a copy, was found amongst his papers
since his death (1690) fair written with his
own hand. Mr Hunt of the Temple took
a copy of it, gave it me, which I have hereby
transcribed.—H. S.”</p>

<p>It has been asserted by some writers that
the vampire is not to be found in Indian
lore and legend, and an attempt has been
made to connect this supposititious absence
of the blood-sucking demon with the Brahminical
and Buddhistic vegetarian and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
cremation customs. The Indian belief,
however, in the existence of vampire
spectres is as prevalent as it is in any
other country, although the folk-lore and
legends concerning them may, perhaps, be
more scarce.</p>

<p>Fornari, in his <i>History of Sorcerers</i>, relates
the following story: “In the beginning of
the fifteenth century there lived at Bagdad
an aged merchant who had grown wealthy
in his business and who had an only son
to whom he was tenderly attached. He
resolved to marry him to the daughter
of another merchant, a girl of considerable
fortune, but without any personal attractions.
Abul-Hassan, the merchant’s son,
on being shown the portrait of the lady, requested
his father to delay the marriage
till he could reconcile his mind to it. Instead,
however, of doing this he fell in love
with another girl, the daughter of a sage,
and he gave his father no peace till he
consented to the marriage with the object
of his affections. The old man stood out
as long as he could, but finding that his son
was bent on acquiring the hand of the fair
Nadilla, and was equally resolute not to
accept the rich and ugly lady, he did what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
most fathers under such circumstances
would do—he acquiesced.</p>

<p>“The wedding took place with great
pomp and ceremony, and a happy honeymoon
ensued, which might have been
happier but for one little circumstance
which led to very serious consequences.</p>

<p>“Abul-Hassan noticed that his bride
quitted the nuptial couch as soon as she
thought her husband was asleep, and did
not return to it till an hour before dawn.</p>

<p>“Filled with curiosity, Hassan one night,
feigning sleep, saw his wife rise and leave
the room. He rose, followed cautiously,
and saw her enter the cemetery. By the
straggling moonbeams he saw her go into
a tomb: he stepped in after her.</p>

<p>“The scene within was horrible. A
party of ghouls were assembled with the
spoils of the graves they had violated and
were feasting on the flesh of the long-buried
corpses. His own wife, who, by the
way, never touched supper at home, played
a no inconsiderable part in the hideous
banquet.</p>

<p>“As soon as he could safely escape
Abul-Hassan stole back to his bed.</p>

<p>“He said nothing to his bride till next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
evening when supper was laid, and she
declined to eat; then he insisted on her
partaking, and when she positively refused
he exclaimed roughly: ‘Oh yes, you keep
your appetite for your feasts with the
ghouls.’ Nadilla was silent; she turned
pale and trembled, and without a word
sought her bed. At midnight she rose, fell
on her husband with her nails and teeth,
tore his throat, and, having opened a vein,
attempted to suck his blood; but Abul-Hassan,
springing to his feet, threw her
down and, with a blow, killed her. She
was buried next day.</p>

<p>“Three days after at midnight she reappeared,
attacked her husband again, and
again attempted to suck his blood. He
fled from her and on the morrow opened
her tomb, burnt her to ashes and cast the
ashes into the Tigris.”</p>

<p>There is a monstrous vampire which is
said to delight in sucking the blood of
children, and is known as a Pănangglan.
It has also a liking for sucking the blood
of women at childbirth; but, as it is also
credited with a dread of thorns, the custom
has arisen of placing thorns about the rooms
of Indian houses on the occasions of births.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>One of the Northern Indian witches—the
Jigar-Khor or Liver-eater—is believed
to be possessed of the power of being able
to steal the liver of another by looks and
incantations. A class of witches known as
Bhúts are said to have an extraordinary
fondness for fish, but also eat rice and all
kinds of human food.</p>

<p>Hugh Clifford, in his interesting work
<i>In Court and Kampong</i>, refers to the
“Pĕnangal, that horrible wraith of a woman
who has died in childbirth, and who comes
to torment small children in the guise of a
fearful face and bust with many feet of
bloody, trailing entrails in her wake,”
also of that “weird little white animal, the
<i>Mati-ânak</i>, that makes beast noises round
the graves of children; and of the familiar
spirits that men raise up from the corpses
of babes who have never seen the light, the
tips of whose tongues they bite off and
swallow, after the child has been brought
back to life by magic agencies.”</p>

<p>In the Tamil dream of Harichándra, the
frenzied Sandramáti says to the king:
“I belong to the race of elves, for I killed
thy child in order that I might feed on its
delicate flesh.” The Vetala is said to feed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
chiefly on corpses. The Bhúts and other
dismal ravenous ghosts, who are dreaded
at the moon-wane of the month Katik
(October-November), were not supposed to
devour men, but only their food.</p>

<p>Then there is the Hántu Sàburo, which
chases men into the forest by means of his
dogs, and if they are run down he drinks
their blood. The Hántu Dondong resides
in caves and crevices in rocks. He kills
dogs and wild hogs with the sumpitan,
and then drinks their blood. The Hántu
Parl fastens on to the wound of an injured
person and sucks the blood.</p>

<p>Barth, in his <i>History of Religions</i> (Hinduism),
says that “Siva is identified with
<i>Mrityu</i>, Death, and his old name <i>Pacupati</i>,
Lord of herds, acquires the ominous meaning
of Master of human cattle. He is
chief of the mischievous spirits, of ghouls
and vampires that frequent places of
execution and those where the dead are
buried, and he prowls about with them at
nightfall.”</p>

<p>Other classes of demons are also known
as the <i>Rakshasas</i> or the <i>Pisâchâs</i>, a word
which literally means “flesh-eaters,” which
Delongchamps has translated as “bloodthirsty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
savages,” but other etymologists
actually as “vampires.”</p>

<p>The vampire demon is no stranger to
Australia. Bonwick, in his <i>Daily Life of
the Tasmanians</i>, tells us that: “During
the whole of the first night after the death
of one of their tribe they will sit round the
body, using rapidly a low, continuous recitative
to prevent the evil spirit from
taking it away. This evil spirit was the
ghost of an enemy. Fires at night kept off
these mischievous beings, which were like
the vampires of Europe.”</p>

<span class="smaller">VAMPIRISM IN GERMANY AND SURROUNDING COUNTRIES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Germany, the home of modern philosophy,
is not free from the belief in the reality of
the vampire apparition, although the more
horrible forms of the superstition are not
frequently encountered. Crosses are, however,
frequently erected at the head, or by
the side, of graves, even in Protestant
cemeteries, in order that their presence
may prevent the occupants from being
controlled by any demon that might, but
for the presence of such charm, take
possession of a body; and the <i>Nachzehrer</i>
is as much dreaded in many parts of Germany
as the <i>Vrykolaka</i> is in Russia. In
some parts of the Kaiser’s dominions, food
is still buried with the corpse in order to
assuage any pangs of hunger that may arise;
and even when this is not done, a few grains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of corn or rice are scattered upon the grave
as a survival of the ancient custom. In
Diesdorf it is believed that if money is not
placed in the mouth of a dead person at
burial, or his name not cut from his shirt,
he will, in all probability, become a
Nachzehrer, and his ghost issue from the
grave in the form of a pig. Another sure
preventive of such a calamity is to break
the neck of a dead body.</p>

<p>The following story was contributed by
Dr Franz Hartmann to the <i>Occult Review</i>
for September 1909, under the title of “An
Authenticated Vampire Story”:—</p>

<p>“On June 10th, 1909, there appeared in
a prominent Vienna paper (the <i>Neues
Wiener Journal</i>) a notice saying that the
castle of B—— had been burned by the
populace, because there was a great mortality
among the peasant children, and it
was generally believed that this was due
to the invasion of a vampire, supposed to
be the last Count B——, who died and
acquired that reputation. The castle was
situated in a wild and desolate part of the
Carpathian Mountains, and was formerly
a fortification against the Turks. It was
not inhabited, owing to its being believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
to be in the possession of ghosts; only a wing
of it was used as a dwelling for the caretaker
and his wife.</p>

<p>“Now it so happened that, when I read
the above notice, I was sitting in a coffee-house
at Vienna in company with an old
friend of mine who is an experienced
occultist and editor of a well-known journal,
and who had spent several months in the
neighbourhood of the castle. From him
I obtained the following account, and it
appears that the vampire in question was
probably not the old Count, but his beautiful
daughter, the Countess Elga, whose photograph,
taken from the original painting, I
obtained. My friend said: ‘Two years
ago I was living at Hermannstadt, and
being engaged in engineering a road through
the hills, I often came within the vicinity
of the old castle, where I made the acquaintance
of the old castellan, or caretaker, and
his wife, who occupied a part of the wing
of the house, almost separate from the
main body of the building. They were a
quiet old couple and rather reticent in
giving information or expressing an opinion
in regard to the strange noises which were
often heard at night in the deserted halls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
or of the apparitions which the Wallachian
peasants claimed to have seen when they
loitered in the surroundings after dark.
All I could gather was that the old Count
was a widower and had a beautiful daughter,
who was one day killed by a fall from her
horse, and that soon after the old man died
in some mysterious manner, and the bodies
were buried in a solitary graveyard belonging
to a neighbouring village. Not long
after their death an unusual mortality was
noticed among the inhabitants of the village:
several children and even some grown
people died without any apparent illness;
they merely wasted away; and thus a
rumour was started that the old Count had
become a vampire after his death. There
is no doubt that he was not a saint, as he
was addicted to drinking, and some shocking
tales were in circulation about his conduct
and that of his daughter; but whether
there was any truth in them, I am not in
a position to say.</p>

<p>“‘Afterwards the property came into the
possession of ——, a distant relative of the
family, who is a young man and officer in
a cavalry regiment at Vienna. It appears
that the heir enjoyed his life at the capital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and did not trouble himself much about
the old castle in the wilderness; he did not
even come to look at it, but gave his
directions by letter to the janitor, telling
him merely to keep things in order and to
attend to repairs, if any were necessary.
Thus the castellan was actually master of
the house, and offered its hospitality to me
and my friends.</p>

<p>“One evening I and my two assistants,
Dr E——, a young lawyer, and
Mr W——, a literary man, went to inspect
the premises. First we went to the stables.
There were no horses, as they had been
sold; but what attracted our special attention
was an old, queer-fashioned coach
with gilded ornaments and bearing the
emblems of the family. We then inspected
the rooms, passing through some halls and
gloomy corridors, such as may be found
in any old castle. There was nothing
remarkable about the furniture; but in
one of the halls there hung in a frame an
oil-painting, a portrait, representing a lady
with a large hat and wearing a fur coat. We
were all involuntarily startled on beholding
this picture—not so much on account of
the beauty of the lady, but on account of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the uncanny expression of her eyes; and
Dr E——, after looking at the picture for
a short time, suddenly exclaimed: ‘How
strange! The picture closes its eyes and
opens them again, and now it begins to
smile!’</p>

<p>“Now Dr E—— is a very sensitive person,
and has more than once had some experience
in spiritism, and we made up our minds to
form a circle for the purpose of investigating
this phenomenon. Accordingly, on the
same evening we sat around a table in an
adjoining room, forming a magnetic chain
with our hands. Soon the table began to
move and the name <i>Elga</i> was spelled.
We asked who this Elga was, and the answer
was rapped out: ‘The lady whose picture
you have seen.’</p>

<p>“‘Is the lady living?’ asked Mr W——.
This question was not answered; but
instead it was rapped out: ‘If W——
desires it, I will appear to him bodily to-night
at two o’clock.’ W—— consented,
and now the table seemed to be endowed
with life and manifested a great affection
for W——; it rose on two legs and pressed
against his breast, as if it intended to
embrace him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“We inquired of the castellan whom the
picture represented; but to our surprise
he did not know. He said that it was the
copy of a picture painted by the celebrated
painter Hans Markart of Vienna, and had
been bought by the old Count because its
demoniacal look pleased him so much.</p>

<p>“We left the castle, and W—— retired
to his room at an inn a half-hour’s journey
distant from that place. He was of a
somewhat sceptical turn of mind, being
neither a firm believer in ghosts and apparitions
nor ready to deny their possibility.
He was not afraid, but anxious to
see what would come of his agreement,
and for the purpose of keeping himself
awake he sat down and began to write an
article for a journal.</p>

<p>“Towards two o’clock he heard steps on
the stairs and the door of the hall opened;
there was the rustling of a silk dress and the
sound of the feet of a lady walking to and
fro in the corridor.</p>

<p>“It may be imagined that he was somewhat
startled; but taking courage, he said
to himself: ‘If this is Elga, let her come in.’
Then the door of the room opened and
Elga entered. She was most elegantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
dressed, and appeared still more youthful
and seductive than the picture. There
was a lounge on the other side of the table
where W—— was writing, and there she
silently posted herself. She did not speak,
but her looks and gestures left no doubt
in regard to her desires and intentions.</p>

<p>“Mr W—— resisted the temptation and
remained firm. It is not known whether
he did so out of principle or timidity or
fear. Be this as it may, he kept on writing,
looking from time to time at his visitor
and silently wishing that she would leave.
At last, after half an hour, which seemed
to him much longer, the lady departed in
the same manner in which she came.</p>

<p>“This adventure left W—— no peace,
and we consequently arranged several sittings
at the old castle, where a variety of
uncanny phenomena took place. Thus,
for instance, once the servant-girl was about
to light a fire in the stove, when the door
of the apartment opened and Elga stood
there. The girl, frightened out of her wits,
rushed from the room, tumbling down the
stairs in terror with the lamp in her hand,
which broke, and came very near to setting
her clothes on fire. Lighted lamps and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
candles went out when brought near the
picture, and many other ‘manifestations’
took place which it would be tedious to
describe; but the following incident ought
not to be omitted.</p>

<p>“Mr W—— was at that time desirous
of obtaining the position as co-editor of a
certain journal, and a few days after the
above-narrated adventure he received a
letter in which a noble lady of high position
offered him her patronage for that purpose.
The writer requested him to come to a
certain place the same evening, where he
would meet a gentleman who would give
him further particulars. He went, and was
met by an unknown stranger, who told him
that he was requested by the Countess
Elga to invite Mr W—— to a carriage
drive, and that she would await him at
midnight at a certain crossing of two roads,
not far from the village. The stranger then
suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>“Now it seems that Mr W—— had
some misgivings about the meeting and
drive, and he hired a policeman as detective
to go at midnight to the appointed place,
to see what would happen. The policeman
went and reported next morning that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
he had seen nothing but the well-known,
old-fashioned carriage from the castle, with
two black horses, standing there as if waiting
for somebody, and that as he had no
occasion to interfere, he merely waited
until the carriage moved on. When the
castellan of the castle was asked, he swore
that the carriage had not been out that
night, and in fact it could not have been
out, as there were no horses to draw it.</p>

<p>“But that is not all, for on the following
day I met a friend who is a great sceptic
and disbeliever in ghosts, and always used
to laugh at such things. Now, however,
he seemed to be very serious and said:
‘Last night something very strange happened
to me. At about one o’clock this
morning I returned from a late visit, and
as I happened to pass the graveyard of the
village, I saw a carriage with gilded ornaments
standing at the entrance. I wondered
about this taking place at such an
unusual hour, and being curious to see
what would happen, I waited. Two elegantly
dressed ladies issued from the carriage.
One of these was young and pretty,
but threw at me a devilish and scornful
look as they both passed by and entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the cemetery. There they were met by a
well-dressed man, who saluted the ladies
and spoke to the younger one, saying:
“Why, Miss Elga! Are you returned so
soon?” Such a queer feeling came over
me that I abruptly left and hurried home.’</p>

<p>“This matter has not been explained;
but certain experiments which we subsequently
made with the picture of Elga
brought out some curious facts.</p>

<p>“To look at the picture for a certain
time caused me to feel a very disagreeable
sensation in the region of the solar plexus.
I began to dislike the portrait and proposed
to destroy it. We held a sitting in the
adjoining room; the table manifested a
great aversion to my presence. It
was rapped out that I should leave the
circle, and that the picture must not be
destroyed. I ordered a Bible to be brought
in, and read the beginning of the first
chapter of St John, whereupon the above-mentioned
Mr E—— (the medium) and
another man present claimed that they saw
the picture distorting its face. I turned
the frame and pricked the back of the
picture with my penknife in different places,
and Mr E——, as well as the other man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
felt all the pricks, although they had retired
to the corridor.</p>

<p>“I made the sign of the pentagram over
the picture, and again the two gentlemen
claimed that the picture was horribly distorting
its face.</p>

<p>“Soon afterwards we were called away
and left that country. Of Elga I heard
nothing more.”</p>

<p>Thus far goes the account of my friend
the editor.</p>

<p>Siegbert’s <i>Chronicle</i> for the year 858 has
the following story: “There appeared
this year in the diocese of Mentz a spirit
which discovered himself at first by throwing
stones and beating against the walls of
houses, as if it had been with a great
mallet. He then proceeded to speak and
reveal secrets, and discovered the authors
of several thefts and other matters likely
to breed disturbances in the neighbourhood.
At last he vented his malice upon one
particular person, whom he was industrious
in persecuting and making odious to all
the neighbours by representing him as the
cause of God’s anger against the whole
village. The spirit never forsook the poor
man, but tormented him without intermission,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
burnt all his corn in the barns,
and set every place on fire where he came.
The priests attempted to frighten him away
by exorcisms, prayers, and holy water;
but the spectre answered them with a
volley of stones which wounded several of
them. When the priests were gone he was
heard to bemoan himself and say that he
was forced to take refuge in the cowl of
one of the priests, who had injured the
daughter of a man of consequence in the
village. He continued in this manner to
infest the village for three years together,
and never gave over till he had set every
house in it on fire.”</p>

<span class="smaller">VAMPIRISM IN HUNGARY, BAVARIA, AND SILESIA</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Hungarians believe that those who have
been passive vampires in life become active
vampires after death; that those whose
blood has been sucked in life by vampires
become themselves vampires after death.
In many districts the belief also prevails
that the only way to prevent this calamity
happening is for the threatened victim
to eat some earth from the grave of the
attacking vampire, and to smear his own
body with blood from the body of that
vampire.</p>

<p>That the belief in vampirism is still
current in Hungary was evidenced recently.
The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of February 15th,
1912, contained the following paragraph:
“A Buda-Pesth telegram to the <i>Messaggero</i>
reports a terrible instance of superstition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
A boy of fourteen died some days ago in a
small village. A farmer, in whose employment
the boy had been, thought that the
ghost of the latter appeared to him every
night. In order to put a stop to these
supposed visitations, the farmer, accompanied
by some friends, went to the cemetery
one night, stuffed three pieces of garlic
and three stones in the mouth, and thrust
a stake through the corpse, fixing it to the
ground. This was to deliver themselves from
the evil spirit, as the credulous farmer and
his friends stated when they were arrested.”</p>

<p>In 1732, in a village in Hungary, in the
space of three months, seventeen persons
of different ages died of vampirism, some
without being ill, and others after languishing
two or three days. It is reported that a
girl named Stanoska, daughter of the Heyduk
Jotiutso, who went to bed in perfect
health, awoke in the middle of the night
trembling violently and uttering terrible
shrieks, declaring that the son of the Heyduk
Millo, who had been dead nine weeks, had
nearly strangled her in her sleep. She fell
into a languid state and died at the end
of three days. Young Millo was exhumed
and found to be a vampire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Calmet, in his work <i>The Phantom World</i>,
relates the following: “About fifteen years
ago a soldier who was billeted at the house
of a Haidamaque peasant, on the frontiers
of Hungary, as he was one day sitting at
table near his host, the master of the house,
saw a person he did not know come in and
sit down to table also with them. The
master of the house was strangely frightened
at this, as were the rest of the company.
The soldier knew not what to think
of it, being ignorant of the matter in question.
But the master of the house being
dead the very next day, the soldier inquired
what it meant. They told him it was the
body of the father of the host, who had
been dead and buried for ten years, who
had thus come to sit down next to him,
and had announced and caused his death.</p>

<p>“The soldier informed the regiment of it
in the first place, and the regiment gave
notice of it to the general officers, who
commissioned the Count de Cabreras, captain
of the regiment of Alandetti infantry,
to make information concerning this circumstance.
Having gone to the place with
some other officers, a surgeon and an
auditor, they heard the depositions of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the people belonging to the house, who
decided unanimously that the ghost was
the father of the master of the house, and
that all the soldier had said and reported
was the exact truth, which was confirmed
by all the inhabitants of the village.</p>

<p>“In consequence of this the corpse of
the spectre was exhumed and found to be
like that of a man who had just expired,
and his blood like that of a living man.
The Count de Cabreras had his head cut off
and caused him to be laid again in the tomb.
He also took information concerning other
similar ghosts: among others, of a man dead
more than thirty years who had come back
three times to his house at meal-time.
The first time he had sucked the blood from
the neck of his own brother, the second
time from one of his sons, and the third
time from one of the servants in the house;
and all three died of it instantly and on
the spot. Upon this deposition the commissary
had this man taken out of his grave,
and finding that, like the first, his blood was
in a fluidic state like that of a living person,
he ordered them to run a large nail into
his temple and then to lay him again in
the grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“He caused a third to be burned who
had been buried more than sixteen years
and had sucked the blood and caused the
death of two of his sons. The commissary
having made his report to the general
officers, was deputed to the Emperor,
who commanded that some officers both
of war and of justice, some physicians and
surgeons and some learned men should be
sent to examine the causes of these extraordinary
events. The person who related
these particulars to us had heard them
from the Count de Cabreras at Fribourg in
1730.”</p>

<p>Raufft tells the story of a man named
“Peter Plogojowitz, an inhabitant of a
village in Hungary called Kisolova, who,
after he had been buried more than ten
years, appeared by night to several persons
in the village, while they were asleep, and
squeezed their throats in such a manner
that they expired within twenty-four hours.
There died in this way no less than nine
persons in eight days; and the widow of
this Plogojowitz deposed that she herself
had been visited by him since his death, and
that his errand was to demand his shoes;
which frightened her so much that she at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
once left Kisolova and went to live somewhere
else.</p>

<p>“These circumstances determined the inhabitants
of the village to dig up the body
of Plogojowitz and burn it, in order to put
a stop to such troublesome visits. Accordingly
they applied to the commanding
officer of the Emperor’s troops in the
district of Gradisca, in the kingdom of
Hungary, and to the incumbent of the place,
for leave to dig up the corpse. They both
made a great many scruples about granting
it; but the peasants declared plainly that if
they were not permitted to dig up this accursed
carcase, which they were fully convinced
was a vampire, they would be forced
to leave the village and settle where they
could.</p>

<p>“The officer who gave this account, seeing
that there was no hindering them either
by fair means or foul, came in person,
accompanied by the minister of Gradisca,
to Kisolova, and they were both present
at the digging up of the corpse, which they
found to be free from any bad smell, and
perfectly sound, as if it had been alive,
except that the tip of the nose was a little
dry and withered. The beard and hair were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
grown fresh and a new set of nails had sprung
up in the room of the old ones that had fallen
off. Under the former skin, which looked
pale and dead, there appeared a new one,
of a natural fresh colour; and the hands
and feet were as entire as if they belonged
to a person in perfect health. They observed
also that the mouth of the vampire was full
of fresh blood, which the people were
persuaded had been sucked by him from
the persons he had killed.</p>

<p>“The officer and the divine having diligently
examined into all the circumstances,
the people, being fired with fresh indignation,
and growing more fully persuaded
that this carcase was the real cause of the
death of their countrymen, ran immediately
to fetch a sharp stake, which being driven
into his breast, there issued from the
wound, and also from his nose and mouth,
a great quantity of fresh, ruddy blood;
and something which indicated a sort of
life, was observed to come from him. The
peasants then laid the body upon a pile
of wood, and burnt it to ashes.”</p>

<p>Calmet says he was told by M. de Vassimont,
who was sent to Moravia by Leopold,
first Duke of Lorraine, that he was informed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
by public report that it was common
enough in that country to see men who had
died some time before present themselves
in a party and sit down to the table with
persons of their acquaintance without saying
anything, but that nodding to one of the
party he would infallibly die some days
afterwards. M. de Vassimont received confirmation
of this story from several persons,
amongst others an old curé who said he
had seen more than one instance of it.
The priest added that the inhabitants had
been delivered from these troublesome
spectres owing to the fact that their corpses
had been taken up and burned or destroyed
in some way or other.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century
several vampire investigations were held
at the instigation of the Bishop of Olmutz.
The village of Liebava was particularly
infested, and a Hungarian placed himself
on the top of the church tower and just
before midnight saw a well-known vampire
issue from his tomb, and, leaving his
winding-sheet behind him, proceed on his
rounds. The Hungarian descended from
the tower and took away the sheet and
ascended the tower again. When the vampire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
returned he flew into a great fury
because of the absence of the sheet. The
Hungarian called to him to come up to the
tower and fetch it. The vampire mounted
the ladder, but just before he reached the
top the Hungarian gave him a blow on the
head which threw him down to the churchyard.
His assailant then descended, cut
off the vampire’s head with a hatchet, and
from that time the vampire was no more
heard of.</p>

<p>In 1672 there dwelt in the market town
of Kring, in the Archduchy of Krain, a man
named George Grando, who died, and was
buried by Father George, a monk of St
Paul, who, on returning to the widow’s
house, saw Grando sitting behind the door.
The monk and the neighbours fled. Soon
stories began to circulate of a dark figure
being seen to go about the streets by night,
stopping now and then to tap at the door
of a house, but never to wait for an answer.
In a little while people began to die mysteriously
in Kring, and it was noticed that the
deaths occurred in the houses at which the
spectred figure had tapped its signal. The
widow Grando also complained that she
was tormented by the spirit of her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
who night after night threw her into a deep
sleep with the object of sucking her blood.
The Supan, or chief magistrate, of Kring
decided to take the usual steps to ascertain
whether Grando was a vampire. He called
together some of the neighbours, fortified
them with a plentiful supply of spirituous
liquor, and they sallied off with torches and
a crucifix.</p>

<p>Grando’s grave was opened, and the body
was found to be perfectly sound and not
decomposed, the mouth being opened with a
pleasant smile, and there was a rosy flush
on the cheeks. The whole party were
seized with terror and hurried back to
Kring, with the exception of the Supan.
The second visit was made in company
with a priest, and the party also took a
heavy stick of hawthorn sharpened to a
point. The grave and body were found
to be exactly as they had been left. The
priest kneeled down solemnly and held
the crucifix aloft: “O vampire, look at
this,” he said; “here is Jesus Christ who
loosed us from the pains of hell and died
for us upon the tree!”</p>

<p>He went on to address the corpse, when it
was seen that great tears were rolling down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the vampire’s cheeks. A hawthorn stake
was brought forward, and as often as they
strove to drive it through the body the
sharpened wood rebounded, and it was not
until one of the number sprang into the
grave and cut off the vampire’s head that
the evil spirit departed with a loud shriek
and a contortion of the limbs.</p>

<p>Similar stories to this were continually
being circulated from the borders of Hungary
to the Baltic.</p>

<p>At one time the spectre of a village
herdsman near Kodom, in Bavaria, began to
appear to several inhabitants of the place,
and either in consequence of their fright or
from some other cause, every person who
had seen the apparition died during the
week afterwards. Driven to despair, the
peasants disinterred the corpse and pinned
it to the ground with a long stake. The
same night he appeared again, plunging
people into convulsions of fright, and suffocated
several of them. Then the village
authorities handed the body over to the
executioner, who caused it to be carried into
a field adjoining the cemetery, where it was
burned. The corpse howled like a madman,
kicking and tearing as if it had been alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>When it was run through again with
sharp-pointed stakes, before the burning,
it uttered piercing cries and vomited masses
of crimson blood. The apparition of the
spectre ceased only after the corpse had been
reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>Fortis, in his <i>Travels into Dalmatia</i>, says
that the Moslacks have no doubt as to
the existence of vampires, and attribute to
them, as in Transylvania, the sucking of the
blood of infants. Therefore, when a man
dies, and he is suspected of vampirism, or
of being a <i>vukodlak</i>—the term they employ—they
cut his hams and prick his whole
body with pins, pretending that he will be
unable to walk about after this operation
has been performed. There are even
instances of Moolacchi who, imagining
that they may possibly thirst for human
blood after death, particularly the blood
of children, entreat their heirs, and
sometimes even make them promise, to
treat them in this manner directly after
death.</p>

<p>Dr Henry More, in his <i>Antidote against
Atheism</i>, argues for the reality of vampires,
and relates the following stories.</p>

<p>“A shoemaker of Breslau, in Silesia, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
1591 terminated his life by cutting his
throat. His family, however, spread abroad
the report that he had died of apoplexy,
which enabled them to bury him in the
ordinary way and save the disgrace of his
being interred as a suicide. Despite this,
however, the rumour got abroad that the
man had committed suicide. It was also
reported that his ghost had been seen at
the bedsides of several persons, and the
rumours and reports spreading, it was decided
by the authorities to disinter the body.
It had been buried on September 22nd,
1591, and the grave was opened on April
18th, 1592. The body was found to be
entire; it was not in any way putrid, the
joints were flexible, there was no ill smell,
the wound in the throat was visible and there
was no corruption in it. There was also
observed what was claimed to be a magical
mark on the great toe of the right foot—an
excrescence in the form of a rose. The
body was kept above ground for six days,
during which time the apparitions still
appeared. It was then buried beneath
the gallows, but the apparition still came
to the bedsides of the alarmed inhabitants,
pinching and suffocating people, and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
marks of its fingers plainly visible on the
flesh. A fortnight afterwards the body
was again dug up, when it was observed
to have sensibly increased its size since
its last interment. Then the head, arms,
and legs of the corpse were cut off;
the heart, which was as fresh and entire
as that in a freshly killed calf, was
also taken out of the body. The whole
body thus dismembered was consigned
to the flames and the ashes thrown into
the river. The apparition was never seen
afterwards. A servant of the deceased
man was also said to have acted in a
similar manner after her death. Her remains
were also dug up and burned, and
then her apparition ceased to torment the
inhabitants.”</p>

<p>“Johannes Cuntius, a citizen and alderman
of Pentach, in Silesia, when about sixty
years of age, died somewhat suddenly, as
the result of a kick from his horse. At the
moment of his death a black cat rushed
into the room, jumped on to the bed, and
scratched violently at his face. Both at
the time of his death and that of his funeral
a great tempest arose—the wind and
snow ‘made men’s bodies quake and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
teeth chatter in their heads.’ The storm
is said to have ceased with startling suddenness
as the body was placed under the ground.
Immediately after the burial, however,
stories began to circulate of the appearance
of a phantom which spoke to people
in the voice of Cuntius. Remarkable tales
were told of the consumption of milk from
jugs and bowls, of milk being turned into
blood, of old men being strangled, children
taken out of cradles, altar-cloths being
soiled with blood, and poultry killed and
eaten. Eventually it was decided to disinter
the body. It was found that all the
bodies buried above that of Cuntius had
become putrefied and rotten, but his skin
was tender and florid, his joints by no
means stiff, and when a staff was put
between his fingers they closed around it
and held it fast in their grasp. He could
open and shut his eyes, and when a vein
in his leg was punctured the blood sprang
out as fresh as that of a living person.
This happened after the body had been in
the grave for about six months. Great
difficulty was experienced when the body
was cut up and dismembered, by the order
of the authorities, by reason of the resistance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
offered; but when the task was completed,
and the remains consigned to the
flames, the spectre ceased to molest the
natives or interfere with their slumbers or
health.”</p>

<span class="smaller">VAMPIRISM IN SERVIA AND BULGARIA</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The document which gives the particulars
of the following remarkable story is signed
by three regimental surgeons and formally
countersigned by the lieutenant-colonel and
sub-lieutenant, and bears the date June
7th, 1732, with the address Meduegna,
near Belgrade.</p>

<p>“In the spring of 1727 there returned
from the Levant to the village of Meduegna,
near Belgrade, one Arnod Paole, who, in
a few years’ military service and varied
adventure, had amassed enough to purchase
a cottage and an acre or two of land in his
native place, where he gave out that he
meant to pass the remainder of his days.
He kept his word. Arnod had yet scarcely
reached the prime of manhood; and though
he must have encountered the rough as
well as the smooth of life, and have mingled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
with many a wild and reckless companion,
yet his natural good disposition and honest
principles had preserved him unscathed in
the scenes he had passed through. At all
events, such were the thoughts expressed
by his neighbours as they discussed his
return and settlement among them in the
stube of the village hof. Nor did the
frank and open countenance of Arnod, his
obliging habits and steady conduct, argue
their judgments incorrect. Nevertheless,
there was something occasionally noticeable
in his ways, a look and tone that betrayed
inward disquiet. He would often
refuse to join his friends, or on some sudden
plea abruptly quit their society. And he
still more unaccountably, and it seemed
systematically, avoided meeting his pretty
neighbour, Nina, whose father occupied
the next farm to his own. At the age of
seventeen Nina was as charming a picture
of youth, cheerfulness, innocence, and confidence
as you could have seen in all the
world. You could not look into her limpid
eye, which steadily returned your gaze, without
seeing to the bottom of the pure and
transparent spring of her thoughts. Why
then did Arnod shrink from meeting her?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
He was young; had a little property; had
health and industry; and he had told his
friends he had formed no ties in other
lands. Why then did he avoid the fascination
of the pretty Nina, who seemed a being
made to chase from any brow the clouds
of gathering care? But he did so, yet
less and less resolutely, for he felt the
charm of her presence. Who could have
done otherwise? And how long he resisted
the impulse of his fondness for
the innocent girl who sought to cheer his
fits of depression!</p>

<p>“And they were to be united—were betrothed;
yet still the anxious gloom would
fitfully overcast his countenance, even in
the sunshine of those hours.</p>

<p>“‘What is it, dear Arnod, that makes
you sad? It cannot be on my account, I
know, for you were sad before you noticed
me; and that, I think surely, first made
me notice you.’</p>

<p>“‘Nina,’ he answered, ‘I have done, I
fear, a great wrong in trying to gain your
affections. Nina, I have a fixed impression
that I shall not live; yet, knowing this, I
have selfishly made my existence necessary
to your happiness.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“‘How strangely you talk, dear Arnod!
Who in the village is stronger and healthier
than you? You feared no danger when
you were a soldier. What danger do you
fear as a villager of Meduegna?’</p>

<p>“‘It haunts me, Nina.’</p>

<p>“‘But, Arnod, you were sad before you
thought of me. Did you then fear to
die?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Nina, it is something worse than
death.’ And his vigorous frame shook
with agony.</p>

<p>“‘Arnod, I conjure you, tell me.’</p>

<p>“‘It was in Cossova this fate befell me.
Here you have hitherto escaped the terrible
scourge. But there they die, and the dead
visit the living. I experienced the first
frightful visitation, and I fled; but not
till I had sought his grave and executed
the dread expiation from the vampire.’</p>

<p>“Nina’s blood ran cold. She stood horror-stricken.
But her young heart soon mastered
her first despair. With a touching
voice she spoke: ‘Fear not, dear Arnod;
fear not now. I will be your shield, or I
will die with you!’</p>

<p>“And she encircled his neck with her
gentle arms, and returning hope shone, Iris-like,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
amid her falling tears. Afterwards they
found a reasonable ground for banishing
or allaying their apprehension in the lengthy
time which had elapsed since Arnod left
Cossova, during which no fearful visitant
had again approached him; and they
fondly protested <i>that</i> gave them security.</p>

<p>“One day about a week after this conversation
Arnod missed his footing when
on the top of a loaded hay-waggon, and
fell from it to the ground. He was picked
up insensible, and carried home, where,
after lingering a short time, he died. His
interment, as usual, followed immediately.
His fate was sad and premature. But
what pencil could paint Nina’s grief?</p>

<p>“Twenty or thirty days after his decease,
several in the neighbourhood complained
that they were haunted by the deceased
Arnod; and what was more to the purpose,
four of them died. The evil looked at
sceptically was bad enough, but aggravated
by the suggestions of superstition it spread
a panic through the whole district. To
allay the popular terror, and, if possible,
to get at the root of the evil, a determination
was come to publicly to disinter the
body of Arnod, with the view of ascertaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
whether he really was a vampire, and,
in that event, of treating him conformably.
The day fixed for these proceedings was
the fortieth after his burial.</p>

<p>“It was on a grey morning in early
August that the commission visited the
cemetery of Meduegna, which, surrounded
with a wall of stone, lies sheltered by the
mountain that, rising in undulating green
slopes, irregularly planted with fruit-trees,
ends in an abrupt craggy ridge, covered
with underwood. The graves were, for
the most part, neatly kept, with borders
of box, or something like it, and flowers
between, and at the head of most, a small
wooden cross, painted black, bearing the
name of the tenant. Here and there a
stone had been raised. One of terrible
height, a single narrow slab, ornamented
with grotesque Gothic carvings, dominated
over the rest. Near this lay the grave of
Arnod Paole, towards which the party
moved. The work of throwing out the
earth was begun by the grey, careful
old sexton, who lived in the Leichenhaus
beyond the great crucifix. Near the grave
stood two military surgeons or <i>feldscherers</i>
from Belgrade, and a drummer-boy, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
held their case of instruments. The boy
looked on with keen interest; and when
the coffin was exposed and rather roughly
drawn out of the grave, his pale face and
bright, intent eye showed how the scene
moved him. The sexton lifted the lid of
the coffin; the body had become inclined
to one side. Then, turning it straight:
‘Ha, ha! What? Your mouth not
wiped since last night’s work?’</p>

<p>“The spectators shuddered; the
drummer-boy sank forward, fainting, and
upset the instrument case, scattering its
contents; the senior surgeon, infected
with the horror of the scene, repressed
a hasty exclamation. They threw water
on the drummer-boy and he recovered,
but would not leave the spot. Then they
inspected the body of Arnod. It looked
as if it had not been dead a day. After
handling it, the scarfskin came off, but
below were <i>new skin and new nails</i>! How
could they have come there but from this
foul feeding? The case was clear enough:
there lay before them the thing they
dreaded—the vampire! So, without more
ado, they simply drove a stake through
poor Arnod’s chest, whereupon a quantity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
of blood gushed forth, and the corpse
uttered a dreadful groan.</p>

<p>“‘Murder! Murder!’ shrieked the
drummer-boy, as he rushed wildly, with
convulsed gestures, from the scene.”</p>

<p>The body of Arnod was then burnt to
ashes, which were returned to the grave.
The authorities further staked and burnt
the bodies of the four others who were
supposed to have been infected by Arnod.
No mention is made of the state in which
they were found. The adoption of these
decisive measures failed, however, entirely
to extinguish the evil, which continued
still to hang about the village. About five
years afterwards it had again become very
rife, and many died through it; whereupon
the authorities determined to make another
and a complete clearance of the vampire
in the cemetery, and with that object
they had all the graves, to which suspicion
attached, opened, and their contents
officially anatomised, and the following are
abridgments of the medical reports:—</p>

<p>1. A woman of the name of Stana,
twenty years of age, who had died three
months before, of a three days’ illness
following her confinement. She had before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
her death avowed that she had <i>anointed</i>
herself with the blood of a vampire, to
liberate herself from his persecution.
Nevertheless she had died. Her body was
entirely free from decomposition. On opening
it the chest was found filled with recently
effused blood, and the bowels had
exactly the appearance of sound health.
The skin and nails of her hands and feet
were loose and came off, but underneath
were new skin and nails.</p>

<p>2. A woman of the name of Miliza, who
had died at the end of a three months’
illness. The body had been buried ninety
and odd days. In the chest was liquid
blood. The viscera were as in the former
instance. The body was declared by a
heyduk, who recognised it, to be in better
condition and fatter than it had been in
the woman’s legitimate lifetime.</p>

<p>3. The body of a child eight years old,
that had likewise been buried ninety days;
it was in the vampire condition.</p>

<p>4. The son of a heyduk, named Milloc,
sixteen years old. The body had lain in
the grave nine weeks. He had died after
three days’ indisposition, and was in the
condition of a vampire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>5. Joachim, likewise the son of a heyduk,
seventeen years old. He had died after
three days’ illness; had been buried eight
weeks and some days; was found in the
vampire state.</p>

<p>6. A man of the name of Rusha, who had
died of an illness of ten days’ duration and
had been six weeks buried, in whom likewise
fresh blood was found in the chest.</p>

<p>7. The body of a girl ten years of age
who had died two months before. It was
likewise in the vampire state, perfectly undecomposed,
with blood in the chest.</p>

<p>8. The body of the wife of one Hadnuck,
buried seven weeks before; and that of
her infant eight weeks old, buried only
twenty-one days. They were both in a
state of decomposition, though buried in
the same ground and closely adjoining the
others.</p>

<p>9. A servant, by name Rhade, twenty-three
years of age; he had died after an
illness of three months’ duration, and the
body had been buried five weeks. It was
in a state of decomposition.</p>

<p>10. The body of the heyduk Stanco,
sixty years of age, who had died six weeks
previously. There was much blood and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
other fluid in the chest and abdomen, and
the body was in a vampire condition.</p>

<p>11. Millac, a heyduk, twenty-five years old.
The body had been in the earth six weeks.
It was also in the vampire condition.</p>

<p>12. Stanjoika, the wife of a heyduk,
twenty years old; had died after an illness
of three days, and had been buried
eighteen. The countenance was florid.
There was blood in the chest and in the
heart. The viscera were perfectly sound,
the skin remarkably flush.</p>

<p>The vampire tradition in its original
loathsomeness, however, is to be found only
in the Bulgarian provinces, whither the
knowledge of the superstition was first
imported from Dalmatia and Albania. In
the former country the vampire is known
by the name of <i>wukodlak</i>.</p>

<p>St Clair and Brophy, in their work on
Bulgaria, state that in Bulgaria the vampire
is no longer a dead body possessed by
a demon, but a soul in revolt against the
inevitable principle of corporeal death. He
is detected by a hole in the tombstone
which is placed over his grave, which hole
is filled up by the medicine man with dirt
mixed with poisonous herbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>Vampirism is claimed to be hereditary
as well as epidemic and endemic, and
vampires are also stated to be capable
of exercising considerable physical force.
Stories are told of men who have had their
jaws broken, as well as their limbs, as the
result of their struggles with vampires.</p>

<p>About 1863 there was a local epidemic
of vampirism in one of the villages of
Bulgaria, when the place became so infested
by them that the inhabitants were
forced to assemble together in two or
three houses, burn candles at night, and
watch by turns in order to avoid the
assaults made by the Obours, who lit up
the streets with their sparkles. Some of
the most enterprising of these threw their
shadows on the walls of the rooms where
the peasants were assembled through fear,
while others howled and shrieked and
swore outside the door, entered the abandoned
houses, spat blood on the floors,
turned everything topsy-turvy, and smeared
everything, even the pictures of the saints,
with cow-dung, until an old lady, suspected
of witchcraft, discovered and laid
the troublesome spirit, and afterwards the
village was free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>When the Bulgarian vampire has finished
his forty days’ apprenticeship to the world
of shadows, he rises from the tomb in
bodily form, and is able to pass himself off
as a human being living in the natural
manner.</p>

<p>In Slavonic countries the vampire is said
to be possessed of only one nostril, but
is credited with possessing a sharp point
at the end of his tongue, like the sting
of a bee.</p>

<p>In Bulgaria one method of abolishing
the vampire is said to be by bottling him.
The sorcerer, armed with the picture of
some saint, lies in ambush until he sees the
vampire pass, when he pursues him with
his picture. The vampire takes refuge in
a tree or on the roof of a house, but his
persecutor follows him up with the talisman,
driving him away from all shelter in
the direction of a bottle specially prepared,
in which is placed some favourite food of
the vampire. Having no other alternative,
he enters this prison, and is immediately
fastened down with a cork on the interior
of which is a fragment of an eikon or holy
picture. The bottle is then thrown into the
fire and the vampire disappears for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>In Bulgaria the vampire does not invariably
seem to have the thirst for human
blood, unless there happens to be a shortage
in his human food—a distinction which
marks him from the species found in other
countries.</p>

<span class="smaller">VAMPIRE BELIEF IN RUSSIA</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Slavonic belief in vampires is one of
the characteristic features of their creed.</p>

<p>The Little Russians hold that, if the vampire’s
hands have grown numb from remaining
long crossed in the grave, he makes
use of his teeth, which are like steel. When
he has gnawed his way with these through
all obstacles, he first destroys the babies
he finds in a house, and afterwards the older
inmates. If fine salt be scattered on the
floor of a room, the vampire’s footsteps
may be traced to his grave, in which he
will be found resting with rosy cheek and
gory mouth.</p>

<p>The Kashoubes say that when a <i>vieszcy</i>,
as they call a vampire, wakes from his sleep
within the grave he begins to gnaw his
hands and feet, and as he gnaws, first his
relatives, and then his neighbours, sicken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
and die. When he has finished his own
store of flesh, he rises at midnight and
destroys cattle or climbs a belfry and
sounds the bell. All who hear the ill-omened
tones will soon die. Generally he
sucks the blood of sleepers.</p>

<p>Ralston, in his <i>Songs of the Russian
People</i>, says that it is in the Ukraine and in
White Russia—so far as the Russian Empire
is concerned—that traditions are most rife
about this ghastly creation of morbid fancy,
and that the Little Russians attribute the
birth of a vampire to an unholy union
between a witch and a werwolf or a devil.</p>

<p>He relates the following as a specimen of the
vampire stories prevalent in the country:—</p>

<p>“A peasant was driving past a graveyard
after it had grown dark. After him came
running a stranger, dressed in a red shirt
and a new jacket, who said: ‘Stop!
Take me as your companion.’</p>

<p>“‘Pray take a seat.’</p>

<p>“They enter a village, drive up to this
and that house. Though the gates are wide
open, yet the stranger says, ‘Shut tight!’
for on those gates crosses have been branded.
They drive on to the very last house: the
gates are barred, and from them hangs a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
padlock weighing a score of pounds; but
there is no cross there, and the gates open
of their own accord.</p>

<p>“They go into the house: there on the
bench lie two sleepers—an old man and a
lad. The stranger takes a pail, places it
near the youth, and strikes him on the back;
immediately the back opens, and forth
flows rosy blood. The stranger fills the
pail full and drinks it dry. Then he fills
another pail with blood from the old man,
slakes his brutal thirst, and says to the
peasant: ‘It begins to grow light! Let
us go back to my dwelling.’</p>

<p>“In a twinkling they find themselves
at the graveyard. The vampire would have
clasped the peasant in his arms, but luckily
for him the cocks begin to crow, and the
corpse disappears. The next morning,
when folks come and look, the old man
and the lad are dead.”</p>

<p>According to the Servians and Bulgarians,
unclean spirits enter into the corpses of
malefactors and other evilly disposed persons,
who then become vampires. In some
places the jumping of a boy over the corpse
is considered as fatal as that of a cat.</p>

<p>There is a story told of a mother who lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
in Saratof who cursed her son, and his body
remained free from corruption after burial
for a hundred years. When it was disinterred,
his aged mother, who is said to have
been still alive, pronounced his pardon, and,
at that very moment, the corpse crumbled
into dust.</p>

<p>The Russians say that, when driving a
stake into the body of a vampire, this must
be done by one single blow, as a second
blow will reanimate the corpse.</p>

<p>One group of Russian stories relate to the
sudden resuscitation shortly after death of
wizards and witches at midnight possessed
with the longing to eat the flesh of the
watchers around the bier. The stories
go that the body of the suspected witch
was generally enclosed in a coffin which was
secured with iron bands and carried to the
church, and a watcher was appointed to
read aloud from the Scriptures over the
coffin right through each night until burial.
It was also the duty of the watcher to draw
on the floor a magic circle, within which he
must stand and hold in his hand a hammer,
the ancient weapon of the thunder-god. If
the suspicion that the individual was a
wizard or witch was a correct one, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
mighty wind would arise one night about
twelve o’clock, the iron bands of the coffin
would give way with a terrible crash, the
coffin-lid fall off, and the corpse leap forth
and, uttering a terrible screech, rush at the
watcher, who, if he had not taken the
prescribed precautions, would fall a victim
to the monster, and in the morning there
would be nothing left of him but his bare
bones. The following story of this character
is contained in the records of the
Kharkof government:—</p>

<p>“Once, in the days of old, there died a
terrible sinner. His body was taken into
the church, and the sacristan was told to
read some psalms over him. He took the
precaution to catch a cock and carry it with
him to the church. At midnight the dead
man leaped from his coffin, opened wide his
jaws, and rushed at his victim; but, at that
moment, the sacristan gave the bird a hard
pinch. The cock uttered his usual crow, and
at the same moment the dead man fell
backwards to the ground a numb, motionless
corpse.”</p>

<p>The following story is also given by
Ralston in his collection of Russian folk-stories:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Coffin Lid</i></h3>

<p>“A moujik was driving along one night
with a load of pots. His horse grew tired,
and all of a sudden it came to a standstill
alongside of a graveyard. The moujik unharnessed
his horse and set it free to graze;
meanwhile he laid himself down on one of
the graves. But somehow he didn’t go to
sleep.</p>

<p>“He remained there some time. Suddenly
the grave began to open beneath him; he
felt the movement and sprang to his feet.
The grave having opened, out of it came a
corpse, wrapped in a white shroud, and
holding a coffin lid. He ran to the church,
laid the coffin lid at the door, and then set
off for the village.</p>

<p>“The moujik was a daring fellow. He
picked up the coffin lid and remained
standing beside his cart, waiting to see what
would happen. After a short delay the
dead man came back, and was going to
snatch up his coffin lid—but it was not to
be seen. Then the corpse began to track
it out, traced it up to the moujik, and said:
‘Give me my lid; if you don’t, I’ll tear
you to bits!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“‘And my hatchet—how about that?’
answered the moujik. ‘Why, it’s I who’ll
be chopping you into small pieces!’</p>

<p>“‘Do give it back to me, good man!’
begs the corpse.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll give it when you tell me where
you’ve been and what you’ve done.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ve been in the village, and there
I’ve killed a couple of youngsters.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, tell me how they can be
brought back to life.’</p>

<p>“The corpse reluctantly made answer:
‘Cut off the left skirt of my shroud. Take
it with you, and when you come into the
house where the youngsters were killed,
pour some live coals into a pot and put the
piece of the shroud in with them, and then
lock the door. The lads will be revived by
the smoke immediately.’</p>

<p>“The moujik cut off the left skirt of the
shroud and gave up the coffin lid. The
corpse went to its grave—the grave opened.
But just as the dead man was descending
into it, all of a sudden the cocks began to
crow, and he had not time to get properly
covered over. One end of the coffin lid
remained standing out of the ground.</p>

<p>“The moujik saw all this and made a note<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
of it. The day began to dawn; he harnessed
his horse and drove into the village.
In one of the houses he heard cries and
wailing. In he went—there lay two dead
lads.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t cry,’ said he; ‘I can bring them
to life.’</p>

<p>“‘Do bring them to life, kinsman,’ said
their relatives. ‘We’ll give you half of all
we possess.’</p>

<p>“The moujik did everything as the corpse
had instructed him, and the lads came back
to life. Their relatives were delighted, but
they immediately seized the moujik and
bound him with cords, saying: ‘No, no,
trickster! We’ll hand you over to the
authorities. Since you know how to bring
them back to life, maybe it was you who
killed them!’</p>

<p>“‘What are you thinking about, true
believers? Have the fear of God before
your eyes!’ cried the moujik.</p>

<p>“Then he told them everything that had
happened to him during the night. Well,
they spread the news through the village,
and the whole population assembled and
stormed into the graveyard. They found
the grave from which the dead man had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
come out; they tore it open, and they
drove an aspen stake right into the heart
of the corpse, so that it might no more rise
up and slay. But they rewarded the
moujik handsomely, and sent him home
with great honour.”</p>

<h3><i>The Soldier and the Vampire</i></h3>

<p>“A certain soldier was allowed to go home
on furlough. Well, he walked and walked
and walked, and after a time he began to
draw near to his native village. Not far off
from that village lived a miller in his mill.
In old times, the soldier had been very
intimate with him: why shouldn’t he go
and see his friend? He went. The miller
received him cordially, and at once brought
out liquor; and the two began drinking
and chattering about their ways and doings.
All this took place towards nightfall, and
the soldier stopped so long at the miller’s
that it grew quite dark.</p>

<p>“When he proposed to start for his village,
his host exclaimed: ‘Spend the night
here, trooper; it is very late now, and
perhaps you may run into mischief.’</p>

<p>“‘How so?’</p>

<p>“‘God is punishing us! A terrible warlock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
has died among us, and by night he
rises from his grave, wanders through the
village, and does such things as bring fear
upon the very bailiffs; and so how could you
help being afraid of him?’</p>

<p>“‘Not a bit of it! A soldier is a man who
belongs to the Crown, and Crown property
cannot be drowned in water or burned in
fire. I will be off. I am tremendously
anxious to see my people as soon as
possible.’</p>

<p>“Off he set. His road lay in front of a
graveyard. On one of the graves he saw
a great fire blazing. What is that? Then
he said: ‘Let’s have a look.’ When he
drew near, he saw that the warlock was
sitting at the fire, sewing boots.</p>

<p>“‘Hail, brother!’ calls out the soldier.</p>

<p>“The warlock looked up and said: ‘What
have you come here for?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, I wanted to see what you were
doing.’</p>

<p>“The warlock threw his work aside and
invited the soldier to a wedding.</p>

<p>“‘Come along, brother,’ says he; ‘let’s
enjoy ourselves. There is a wedding going
on in the village.’</p>

<p>“‘Come along,’ says the soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“They came to where the wedding was;
they were given drink, and treated with
the utmost hospitality. The warlock drank
and drank, revelled and revelled, and then
grew angry. He chased all the guests and
relatives out of the house, threw the wedded
pair into a slumber, took out two phials and
an awl, pierced the hands of the bride and
bridegroom with the awl, and began drawing
off their blood. Having done this, he said
to the soldier: ‘Now, let’s be off.’</p>

<p>“Accordingly, they went off. On the way
the soldier said: ‘Tell me, why did you
draw off their blood in those phials?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, in order that the bride and
bridegroom might die. To-morrow morning
no one will be able to wake them. I
alone know how to bring them back to life.’</p>

<p>“‘How’s that managed?’</p>

<p>“‘The bride and bridegroom must have
cuts made in their heels, and some of their
blood must then be poured back into these
wounds. I’ve got the bridegroom’s blood
stowed away in my right-hand pocket, and
the bride’s in my left.’</p>

<p>“The soldier listened to this without letting
a single word escape him. Then the
warlock began boasting again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“‘Whatever I wish,’ says he, ‘that I
can do.’</p>

<p>“‘I suppose it’s quite impossible to get
the better of you,’ says the soldier.</p>

<p>“‘Impossible? If anyone were to make
a pyre of aspen boughs, a hundred loads of
them, and were to burn me on that pyre,
then he’d be able to get the better of me.
Only he’d have to look sharp in burning me,
for snakes and worms and different kinds
of reptiles would creep out of my inside,
and crows and magpies and jackdaws
would come flying up. All these must be
caught and flung on the pyre. If so much
as a single maggot were to escape, then
there’d be no help for it. In that maggot
I should slip away.’</p>

<p>“The soldier listened to all this and did
not forget it. He and the warlock talked
and talked, and at last they arrived at the
grave.</p>

<p>“‘Well, brother,’ said the warlock,
‘now I’ll tear you to pieces, otherwise
you’ll be telling all this.’</p>

<p>“‘What are you talking about? Don’t
you deceive yourself, for I serve God and
the Empire.’</p>

<p>“The warlock gnashed his teeth, howled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
aloud, and sprang at the soldier, who drew
his sword and began laying about him
with sweeping blows. They struggled and
struggled; the soldier was all but at the
end of his strength. ‘Ah,’ thinks he,
‘I’m a lost man, and all for nothing!’
Suddenly the cocks began to crow. The
warlock fell lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>“The soldier took the phials of blood out
of the warlock’s pockets, and went to the
house of his own people. When he had
got there and exchanged greetings with his
relatives, they said: ‘Did you see any
disturbance, soldier?’</p>

<p>“‘No, I saw none.’</p>

<p>“‘There, now! Why, we’ve a terrible piece
of work going on in the village. A warlock
has taken to haunting it.’</p>

<p>“After talking a while they lay down to
sleep. The next morning the soldier awoke
and began asking: ‘I’m told you’ve got
a wedding going on somewhere here.’</p>

<p>“‘There was a wedding in the house of
a rich moujik,’ replied his relatives, ‘but
the bridegroom has died this very night—what
from nobody knows.’</p>

<p>“‘Where does this moujik live?’</p>

<p>“They showed him the house. Thither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
he went without speaking a word. When
he got there he found the whole family
in tears.</p>

<p>“‘What are you mourning about?’
says he.</p>

<p>“‘Such and such is the state of things,
soldier,’ say they.</p>

<p>“‘I can bring your young people to life
again. What will you give me if I do?’</p>

<p>“‘Take what you like, even were it half
of what we have got.’</p>

<p>“The soldier did as the warlock had instructed
him, and brought the young people
back to life. Instead of weeping there began
to be happiness and rejoicing: the soldier
was hospitably treated and well rewarded.
Then—left about face! Off he marched to
Starosta and told the burgomaster to call
the peasants together and to get ready a
hundred loads of aspen wood. Well, they
took the wood into the graveyard, dragged
the warlock out of his grave, placed him
on the pyre, and set it in flames. The
warlock began to burn. His corpse burst,
and out of it came snakes, worms, and
all kinds of reptiles, and up came flying
crows, magpies, and jackdaws. The peasants
knocked them down and flung them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
into the fire, not allowing so much as a
single maggot to creep away! And so
the warlock was thoroughly consumed, and
the soldier collected his ashes and strewed
them to the winds. From that time there
was peace in the village.</p>

<p>“The soldier received the thanks of the
whole community.”</p>

<p>In Russian folk-lore there is a class of
demons known as “heart devourers,” who
touch their victim with an aspen or other
twig credited with magical properties; the
heart then falls out and may be replaced
by some baser one. There is a Moscovian
story in which a hero awakes with the heart
of a hare, the work of a demon while the
man was asleep. He remained a coward
for the rest of his life. In another instance
a very quiet, reserved, inoffensive peasant
received a cock’s heart in exchange for his
own, and afterwards was for ever crowing
like a healthy bird.</p>

<p>The following is taken from the <i>Lettres
Juives</i> of 1738:—</p>

<p>“In the beginning of September there
died in the village of Kisilova, three
leagues from Graditz, an old man who
was sixty-two years of age. Three days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
after he had been buried, he appeared
in the night to his son, and asked him
for something to eat; the son having given
him something, he ate and disappeared.
The next day the son recounted to his
neighbours what had happened. That
night the father did not appear, but the
following night he showed himself and asked
for something to eat. They know not
whether the son gave him anything or not;
but the next day he was found dead in his
bed. On the same day, five or six persons
fell suddenly ill in the village, and died one
after the other in a few days.</p>

<p>“The officer or bailiff of the place, when
informed of what had happened, sent an
account of it to the tribunal of Belgrade,
which despatched to the village two of
these officers and an executioner to examine
into this affair. The imperial officer from
whom we have this account repaired thither
from Graditz to be a witness of what took
place.</p>

<p>“They opened the graves of those who had
been dead six weeks. When they came to
that of the old man, they found him with
his eyes open, having a fine colour, with
natural respiration, nevertheless motionless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
as the dead: whence they concluded
that he was most undoubtedly a vampire.
The executioner drove a stake into his
heart; they then raised a pile and reduced
the corpse to ashes. No mark of vampirism
was found either on the corpse of the son or
on the others.”</p>

<p>The following story is told by Madame
Blavatsky in <i>Isis Unveiled</i>, who states that
she had the account from an eye-witness
of the occurrence:—</p>

<p>“About the beginning of the nineteenth
century there occurred in Russia one of the
most frightful cases of vampirism on record.
The governor of the province of Tch——
was a man of about sixty years of age, of a
cruel and jealous disposition. Clothed with
despotic authority, he exercised it without
stint, as his brutal instincts prompted. He
fell in love with the pretty daughter of a
subordinate officer. Although the girl was
betrothed to a young man whom she loved,
the tyrant forced her father to consent to
his having her marry him; and the poor
victim, despite her despair, became his
wife. His jealous disposition soon exhibited
itself. He beat her, confined her to her
room for weeks together, and prevented her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
seeing anyone except in his presence. He
finally fell sick and died. Finding his
end approaching, he made her swear never
to marry again, and with fearful oaths
threatened that in case she did he would
return from his grave and kill her. He was
buried in the cemetery across the river, and
the young widow experienced no further
annoyance until, getting the better of her
fears, she listened to the importunities of
her former lover, and they were again
betrothed.</p>

<p>“On the night of the customary betrothal
feast, when all had retired, the old mansion
was aroused by shrieks proceeding from her
room. The doors were burst open, and the
unhappy woman was found lying on her bed
in a swoon. At the same time a carriage
was heard rumbling out of the courtyard.
Her body was found to be black and blue
in places, as from the effect of pinches, and
from a slight puncture in her neck drops
of blood were oozing. Upon recovering, she
stated that her deceased husband had suddenly
entered her room, appearing exactly
as in life, with the exception of a dreadful
pallor; that he had upbraided her for her
inconstancy, and then beaten and pinched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
her most cruelly. Her story was disbelieved;
but the next morning the guard
stationed at the other end of the bridge
which spans the river reported that just
before midnight a black coach-and-six had
driven furiously past without answering
their challenge.</p>

<p>“The new governor, who disbelieved the
story of the apparition, took nevertheless
the precaution of doubling the guards
across the bridge. The same thing happened,
however, night after night, the
soldiers declaring that the toll-bar at their
station near the bridge would rise of itself,
and the spectral equipage would sweep
past them, despite their efforts to stop it.
At the same time every night the watchers,
including the widow’s family and the servants,
would be thrown into a heavy sleep;
and every morning the young victim would
be found bruised, bleeding, and swooning as
before. The town was thrown into consternation.
The physicians had no explanations
to offer; priests came to pass
the night in prayer, but as midnight
approached, all would be seized with the
same terrible lethargy. Finally the archbishop
of the province came and performed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the ceremony of exorcism in person. On
the following morning the governor’s widow
was found worse than ever. She was now
brought to death’s door.</p>

<p>“The governor was finally driven to take
the severest measures to stop the ever-increasing
panic in the town. He stationed
fifty Cossacks along the bridge, with orders
to stop the spectral carriage at all hazards.
Promptly at the usual hour it was heard
and seen approaching from the direction
of the cemetery. The officer of the guard
and a priest bearing a crucifix planted
themselves in front of the toll-bar and
together shouted: ‘In the name of God
and the Czar, who goes there?’ Out of
the coach was thrust a well-remembered
head, and a familiar voice responded:
‘The Privy Councillor of State and Governor
C——!’ At the same moment the
officer, the priest, and the soldiers were
flung aside, as by an electric shock, and
the ghostly equipage passed them before
they could recover breath.</p>

<p>“The archbishop then resolved as a last
expedient to resort to the time-honoured
plan of exhuming the body and driving an
oaken stake through its heart. This was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
done with great religious ceremony in the
presence of the whole populace. The story
is that the body was found gorged with
blood, and with red cheeks and lips. At
the instant that the first blow was struck
upon the stake a groan issued from the
corpse and a jet of blood spouted high into
the air. The archbishop pronounced the
usual exorcism, the body was reinterred,
and from that time no more was heard of
the vampire.”</p>

</div>

<p>Voltaire was surprised that in the enlightened
eighteenth century there should
still be people found who believed in the
reality of vampires, and that the doctors of
the Sorbonne should give their <i>imprimatur</i> to
a dissertation on these unpleasant creatures.
Yet from 1730 to 1735 the subject of
vampirism formed a principal topic of
conversation, and may be said to have been
a mania all over the world, with Europe
as a particular centre. Pamphlets on the
subject streamed from the press, the newspapers
vied with one another in recording
fresh achievements of the spectres, and
though the philosophers scoffed at and
ridiculed the belief, yet sovereigns sent
officers and commissioners to report upon
their misdeeds. The favourite scenes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
their exploits were Hungary, Poland, Silesia,
Bohemia, and Moravia, and in those countries
a vampire haunted and tormented
almost every village.</p>

<p>In some parts of Scandinavia a singular
method was adopted for getting rid of
vampires, viz. by instituting judicial
proceedings against them. Inhabitants
were regularly summoned to attend the
inquest; a tribunal was constituted;
charges were preferred with the usual
legal formalities, accusing them of molesting
the houses and introducing death
among the inhabitants; and at the end
of the proceedings judgment was proclaimed.
The priest then entered with
holy water, Mass was celebrated, and it
was held that complete conquest had been
gained over the goblins.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in his translation of
<i>Eyrbyggia Saga</i>, relates a traditional story
of several vampires who committed dreadful
ravages in Iceland in the year 1000, so
that in a household of thirty servants
no less than eighteen died.</p>

<p>Saxo Grammaticus, the earliest chronicler
and writer upon Danish history and folk-lore,
in his <i>Danish History</i> (book i.), dealing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
with the origin of the Danes, relates the
following story:—</p>

<p>One Mith-othin, who was famous for
his juggling tricks, was quickened, as
though by an inspiration from on High,
to seize the opportunity of feigning to
be a god; and, wrapping the minds of
the barbarians in fresh darkness, he led
them by the renown of his jugglings to
pay holy observance to his name. He said
that the wrath of the gods could never
be appeased nor the outrage to their
deity expiated by mixed and indiscriminate
sacrifices, and, therefore, forbade that
prayers for this end should be put up
without distinction, appointing to each of
those above his especial drink-offering.
But when Odin was returning, he cast away
all help of jugglings, went to Finland to
hide himself, and was there attacked and
slain by the inhabitants. Even in his
death his abominations were made manifest,
for those who came nigh his barrow were
cut off by a kind of sudden death; and,
after his end, he spread such pestilence
that he seemed almost to leave a filthier
record in his death than in his life; it was
as though he would extort from the guilty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
a punishment for his slaughter. The inhabitants
being in this trouble, took the
body out of the mound, beheaded it, and
impaled it through the breast with a
sharp stake, and herein that people found
relief.</p>

<p>In book ii. we have the story of Aswid
and Asmund. Aswid died and was buried
with horse and dog. Asmund died and
was buried with his friend, food being
put in for him to eat. Later on the
grave opened, when Asmund appeared and
said: “By some strange enterprise of
the power of hell the spirit of Aswid was
sent up from the nether world, and with
cruel tooth eats the fleet-footed (horse)
and has given his dog to his abominable
jaws. Not sated with devouring the horse
or hound, he soon turned his swift nails
upon me, tearing my cheek and taking off
my ear. Hence the hideous sight of my
slashed countenance, the blood spurts in
the ugly wound. Yet the bringer of horrors
did it not unscathed; for soon I cut off
his head with my steel, and impaled his
guilty carcase with a stake.”</p>

<p>In Malaysia the vampires are mostly
females, and are credited with a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
fondness for fish. They are known as
Langsuirs, and Skeat, in <i>Malay Magic</i>, gives
the following charm for “laying” a Langsuir:—</p>

<p>Abercromby, in his work on the Finns,
says that the Ceremis imagine that the
spirits that cause illness, especially fever
and ague, are continually recruited on the
death of old maids, murderers, and those
that die a violent death. Whenever anyone
becomes dangerously ill, the Lapps feel
sure that one of his deceased relatives wants
his company in the region of the dead,
either from affection or to punish him for
some trespass. The Truks of Altai have
a similar belief. The soul after death
willingly lingers for some time in the house
and leaves it unwillingly, and often takes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
with it some other members of the family
or some of the cattle.</p>

<p>Codrington, in his descriptive work on
the Melanesians, says that there is a belief
in Banks Islands in the existence of a
power like that of vampires. A man or a
woman would obtain this power out of
a morbid desire for communion with some
ghost, and in order to gain it would steal
and eat a morsel of a corpse. The ghost
of the dead man would then join in a close
friendship with the person who had eaten,
and would gratify him by afflicting anyone
against whom his ghostly power might be
directed. The man so afflicted would feel
that something was influencing his life, and
would come to dread some particular person
among his neighbours, who was, therefore,
suspected of being a <i>talamur</i>. This name
was also given to one whose soul was
supposed to go out and eat the soul or
lingering life of a freshly dead corpse.
There was a woman, some years ago, of
whom the story is told that she made no
secret of doing this, and that once on the
death of a neighbour she gave notice that
she should go in the night and eat the
corpse. The friends of the deceased therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
kept watch in the house where the
corpse lay, and at dead of night heard a
scratching at the door, followed by a
rustling noise close by the corpse. One
of them threw a stone and seemed to hit
the unknown thing; and in the morning
the <i>talamur</i> was found with a bruise on her
arm, which she confessed was caused by
a stone thrown at her while she was eating
the corpse.</p>

<p>Baron von Haxthausen, in his work on
Transcaucasia, tells us that there once dwelt
in a cavern in Armenia a vampire called
Dakhanavar, who could not endure anyone
to penetrate into the mountains of Ulmish
Altotem or count their valleys. Everyone
who attempted this had in the night his
blood sucked by the monster from the
soles of his feet until he died. The vampire
was, however, at last outwitted by two
cunning fellows. They began to count
the valleys, and when night came on they
lay down to sleep—taking care to place
themselves with the feet of the one under
the head of the other. In the night the
monster came, felt as usual, and found a
head; then he felt at the other end and
found a head there also. “Well,” cried he,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
“I have gone through the whole 366
valleys of these mountains, and have sucked
the blood of people without end, but never
yet did I come across anyone with two
heads and no feet!” So saying, he ran
away and was never more seen in that
country, but ever after the people knew that
the mountain has 366 valleys.</p>

<p>Even America is not free from the belief
in the vampire. In one of the issues of the
<i>Norwich</i> (U.S.A.) <i>Courier</i> for 1854, there
is the account of an incident that occurred
at Jewett, a city in that vicinity. About
eight years previously, Horace Ray of Griswold
had died of consumption. Afterwards,
two of his children—grown-up sons—died
of the same disease, the last one dying about
1852. Not long before the date of the newspaper
the same fatal disease had seized
another son, whereupon it was determined
to exhume the bodies of the two brothers
and burn them, because the dead were
supposed to feed upon the living; and so
long as the dead body in the grave
remained undecomposed, either wholly
or in part, the surviving members of the
family must continue to furnish substance
on which the dead body could feed. Acting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
under the influence of this strange superstition,
the family and friends of the deceased
proceeded to the burial-ground on
June 8th, 1854, dug up the bodies of the
deceased brothers, and burned them on
the spot.</p>

<p>Dr Dyer, an eminent physician of Chicago,
also reported in 1875 a case occurring
within his own personal knowledge, where
the body of a woman who had died of
consumption was taken from her grave
and her lungs burned, under the belief that
she was drawing after her into the grave
some of her surviving relatives. In 1874,
according to the <i>Providence Journal</i>, in the
village of Placedale, Rhode Island, Mr
William Rose dug up the body of his own
daughter and burned her heart, under the
belief that she was wasting away the lives
of other members of the family.</p>

<p>The vampire is not an unknown spectre
in China, where the measures adopted for
the riddance of the pest are generally the
burning of the mortal remains of the corpse,
or removing to a distance the lid of the
coffin after the vampire has started on his
nocturnal rounds. It is held that the air
thus entering freely into the coffin will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
cause the contents to decay. Another
Chinese cure for vampires is to watch any
suspected coffin until the corpse has quitted
it, and then strew rice, red peas, and bits of
iron around it. The corpse, on returning,
will find it impossible to pass over these
things, and will thus fall an easy prey to
his captors.</p>

<p>The following story of a Chinese vampire
is related by Dr J. J. M. de Groot in his
<i>Religious System of China</i> (vol. v. p. 747):—</p>

<p>“Liu N. N., a literary graduate of the
lowest degree in Wukiang (in Kiangsu),
was in charge of some pupils belonging to
the Tsaing family in the Yuen-hwo district.
In the season of Pure Brightness he returned
home, some holidays being granted him to
sweep his ancestral tombs. This duty
performed, he returned to his post, and
said to his wife: ‘To-morrow I must go;
cook some food for me at an early hour.’
The woman said she would do so, and rose
for the purpose at cockcrow. Their village
lay on the hill behind their dwelling, facing
a brook. The wife washed some rice at that
brook, picked some vegetables in the garden,
and had everything ready, but when it was
light her husband did not rise. She went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
into his room to wake him up, but however
often she called he gave no answer. So
she opened the curtains and found him
lying across the bed, headless, and not a
trace of blood to be seen.</p>

<p>“Terror-stricken, she called the neighbours.
All of them suspected her of adultery
with a lover, and murder, and they warned
the magistrate. This grandee came and
held a preliminary inquest; he ordered the
corpse to be coffined, had the woman put
in fetters, and examined her; so he put her
in gaol, and many months passed away
without sentence being pronounced. Then
a neighbour, coming uphill for some fuel,
saw a neglected grave with a coffin lid bare;
it was quite a sound coffin, strong and solid,
and yet the lid was raised a little; so he
naturally suspected that it had been opened
by thieves. He summoned the people;
they lifted the lid off and saw a corpse with
features like a living person and a body
covered with white hair. Between its arms
it held the head of a man, which they
recognised as that of Liu, the graduate.
They reported the case to the magistrate;
the coroners ordered the head to be taken
away, but it was so firmly grasped in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
arms of the corpse that the combined
efforts of a number of men proved insufficient
to draw it out. So the magistrate
told them to chop off the arms of the
<i>kiangshi</i> (corpse-spectre). Fresh blood
gushed out of the wounds, but in Liu’s head
there was not a drop left, it having been
sucked dry by the monster. By magisterial
order the corpse was burned, and the
case ended with the release of the woman
from gaol.”</p>

<span class="smaller">LIVING VAMPIRES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There is, however, the living vampire,
distinct and separate from the dead species.
In Epirus and Thessaly there is a belief in
living vampires, who leave their shepherd
dwellings by night and roam about, biting
and tearing men and animals and sucking
their blood. In Moldavia and in Wallachia,
the <i>murony</i> are real, living men who
become dogs at night, with the backbone
prolonged to form a sort of tail. They
roam through the villages, and their main
delight is to kill cattle.</p>

<p>In some countries the belief prevails that
the soul of a living man, often of a sorcerer,
leaves its proper body asleep and goes
forth, perhaps in visible form of a straw or
fluff of down, slips through the keyholes,
and attacks its sleeping victim. If the
sleeper should wake in time to clutch this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
tiny soul-embodiment, he may through it
have his revenge by maltreating or destroying
its bodily owner.</p>

<p>The following account was contributed
by me to the <i>Occult Review</i> for July 1910.
The particulars are given exactly as I
wrote them down in shorthand from the
narrator’s dictation. My informant is a
well-known medical practitioner in the
West End of London, who has held various
official appointments in the tropics, and I
received his assurance that the incidents
recorded happened exactly as they are described.
Whether the Indian referred to
is still alive or not is unknown, but certainly
the two other principals, at the time of
writing, are.</p>

<p>Some years ago a small number of English
officials were stationed in a small place in
the tropics. Their residences were about
a quarter of a mile from each other, three
of the bungalows standing in their own
compounds and on separate elevations.
Suddenly one of the officials fell ill, but the
district medical officer was quite unable to
trace the cause of the illness. The official
in question made several applications to
the Colonial Office for transfer to another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
station, saying he felt he should die if he
remained there. At first the application
was refused, but the man got worse and
fell into a very depressed mental condition.
He eventually wrote again, saying that if
his application for transfer could not be
granted he would be compelled to throw
up his appointment—a serious matter for
him, as he had no private means. The
application was then granted; he was
transferred, and he recovered his health.</p>

<p>About eighteen months later another
official had a slight attack of fever, from
which he fully recovered; but after this
attack he began to complain of lassitude
until he went beyond a certain distance from
his residence. The moment he returned to
within this distance he said he felt as though
a wet blanket had been thrown over him,
and nothing could rouse him from the depression
which seized him. He, too, fell
into a low state of health, and on his request
was transferred to another station.</p>

<p>Shortly after this transfer the wife of the
district medical officer, living within the
same area, began to fail in health and
became terribly depressed, apparently from
no cause whatever. Previously she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
been a cheerful, happy woman, indulging
in games and outdoor sports of all kinds,
but now she became most depressed and
miserable. At last, one night, about twelve
o’clock, she woke up shrieking. Her husband
rushed into her room, and she said
she had woken up with a most awful
feeling of depression, and had seen a creature
travelling along the cornice of the
room. She could only describe it as having
a resemblance to something between a
gigantic spider and a huge jelly-fish. Her
husband ascribed it to an attack of nightmare,
but he was disturbed in the same
manner on the following night, when his
wife said she had been awake for a quarter
of an hour, but had not had the strength
to call him before. He found her in a
state of collapse, pulse exceedingly low,
temperature three degrees below normal,
pallid, and in a cold sweat. He mixed her
a draught which had the effect of sending
her to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning she said she must leave
the station and go home, as to stop there
would mean her death. Thinking to divert
her attention, her husband took her away
on a pleasure trip, when he was glad to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
see that she entirely recovered her former
cheerful expression and high spirits. This
state of things lasted until, returning home
in a rickshaw alongside her husband’s, her
face changed and she resumed her gloomy
countenance.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, “is it not awful? I
have been so well and happy all the week,
and now I feel as though a pall had been
thrown over me.”</p>

<p>Matters got worse, and she became more
depressed than ever, and only a few nights
passed before her husband was again called
to her bedside about midnight. He found
his wife in a state of considerable weakness,
although it was not so acute as on
the previous occasion. She said to him:
“I want you to examine the back of my
neck and shoulders very carefully and see
if there is any mark on the skin of any
kind whatever.”</p>

<p>Her husband did so, but could not find
a mark.</p>

<p>“Get a glass and look again. See if you
can find any puncture from a sharp-pointed
tooth.”</p>

<p>He made a microscopical examination,
but found absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“Now,” said his wife, “I can tell you
what is the matter. I dreamed that I was
in a house where I lived when I was a girl.
My little boy called out to me. I ran down
to him, but when I reached the bottom of
the stairs a tall, black man came towards
me. I waved him off, but I could not
move to get away from him, though I
pushed the boy out of his reach. The
man came towards me, seized me in his
arms, sat down at the bottom of the stairs,
put me on his knee, and proceeded to suck
from a point at the upper part of the spine,
just below the neck. I felt that he was
drawing all the blood and life out of me.
Then he threw me from him, and apparently
I lost consciousness as he did so. I
felt as though I was dying. Then I woke
up, and I had been lying here for a quarter
of an hour or twenty minutes before I was
able to call you.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever experienced anything
of this character before?” asked her husband.</p>

<p>“No, I have not; but night after night
for many months I have woken up in
exactly the same state, and that has been
the sole cause of my mental depression. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
have not said anything about it because it
seemed so foolish, but now I have had
this definite dream I cannot hold my
tongue any longer.”</p>

<p>She soon passed into a peaceful sleep,
and on discussing the matter the following
morning with her husband she said: “I
have a feeling somehow that it will not
happen again. I feel quite well and strong,
and all my depression is gone.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon husband and wife were
going together to the club, when around
the corner of the jungle came a tall Indian,
the owner of a large number of milch cattle,
and reputed to be a wealthy man. The
surgeon’s wife suddenly stopped, turned
pale, and said immediately: “That is the
man I saw in my dream.”</p>

<p>The husband went directly up to the
man and said to him: “Look here, I will
give you twelve hours to get out of this
place. I know everything that happened
last night at midnight, and I will kill you
like a dog if I find you here in twelve
hours’ time.”</p>

<p>The Indian disappeared the same night,
taking with him only a few valuables and
a little loose money. He left behind him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the money that was deposited in the bank,
as well as the whole of his property. His
forty head of cattle, worth eighty dollars
each, were impounded, and no news had
been heard of him five years afterwards.
Since his departure no one has complained
of depression and lassitude in that area.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The subject of vampirism does not appear
to have attracted litterateurs greatly. True,
there are the operas of Palma, Hart, Marschner,
and von Lindpainter; and Philostratus
and Phlegon of Tralles have discoursed
upon the phenomena. There are not, however,
many works of fiction based upon the
topic, or many poems in which the subject
is introduced. There is an Anglo-Saxon
poem with the title <i>A Vampyre of the
Fens</i>, and a long, wearisome novel, full of
gruesome details, entitled <i>Varney the Vampire</i>.
Among modern authors, Mr Bram
Stoker has made the vampire the foundation
of his exciting romance <i>Dracula</i>; but
mention of these works almost exhausts
the references to separate works upon the
subject.</p>

<p>Nor are the references to vampires and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
vampirism in the ancient Greek authors
more numerous. The phantom of Achilles
is represented by Euripides (<i>Hec.</i>, 109,
599) as appearing on his tomb clad in
golden armour and appeased by the sacrifice
of a young virgin, whose blood he drank.
Œdipus also in Sophocles (<i>Œd. Col.</i>, 621),
when foretelling a defeat which the Thebans
would sustain near his tomb, declares that
his cold, dead body will drink their warm
blood. Human victims were offered at the
funeral pyre of Patroclus in the <i>Iliad</i>
(vol. i.).</p>

<p>Though human beings are not sacrificed
in the <i>Odyssey</i>, yet the blood of slaughtered
sheep was eagerly lapped up by the ghosts
consulted by Odysseus (xi. 45, 48, 95,
96, 153, etc.). A sheep was also to be
sacrificed at the tombs of mortals, and its
blood was supposed to be an offering acceptable
to the departed spirit.</p>

<p>Pausanias, Strabo, Ælian, and Suidas
relate the legend of Ulysses in his wanderings
coming to the town of Temesa, in Italy,
where one of his associates was stoned to
death by the townsmen for having ravished
a virgin. His ghost forthwith haunted
the inhabitants, and caused them such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
annoyance that many were thinking seriously
of leaving the town when they were
told by Apollo’s oracle that to appease
him they must build the hero a temple,
and sacrifice to him yearly the most beautiful
virgin they had among them. The
temple was accordingly raised: access to
the sacred enclosure was prohibited to all
except the priests, on penalty of death. An
engraving of the evil spirit that is alleged
to have infested Temesa is given on page
18 of Beaumont’s <i>Treatise on Spirits</i> (ed.
1705).</p>

<p>Philostratus, in his <i>Life of Apollonius of
Tyana</i> (iv. 25, p. 165), says that the long
intercourse which took place between a
female spectre and the Corinthian Menippus
was but a prelude to the feast of flesh
and blood in which she meant to revel
after their marriage.</p>

<p>Some have described the Hebrew <i>lilith</i>
as a vampire, but the <i>Jewish Encyclopædia</i>
states that: “There is nothing in the
Talmud to indicate that the <i>lilith</i> was a
vampire.” She was regarded as a nocturnal
demon, flying about in the form of a
night-owl, and stealing children, and was
held to have permission to kill all children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
sinfully begotten, even from a lawful wife.
The <i>lilith</i> is held to have the same signification
as the Greek <i>strix</i> and <i>lamiæ</i>, who
were sorceresses or magicians, seeking to
put to death new-born children. The
ancient Greeks believed that these <i>lamiæ</i>
devoured children, or sucked away all their
blood until they died. Euripides and the
scholiast of Aristophanes mention the <i>lilith</i>
as a dangerous monster, the enemy of
mortals; and Ovid describes the <i>strigæ</i> as
dangerous birds, which fly by night and
seek for infants to devour them and nourish
themselves with their blood. The <i>aluka</i>
of Proverbs xxx. 15 is more akin to the
vampire. It is a blood-sucking, insatiable
monster; the word is synonymous with
<i>algul</i>, the well-known demon of the Arabian
popular stories, “the man-devouring demon
of the waste,” known as the ghoul or goule
in the translated edition of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>.</p>

<p>Goethe, in his ballad <i>The Bride of Corinth</i>,
describes how a young Athenian visits a
friend of his father, to whose daughter he
had been betrothed, and is disturbed at
midnight by the appearance of the vampire
spectre of her whom death has prevented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
from becoming his bride, and who, when
detected, says:—</p>

passage:—</p>

<p>The following legend is related in vol. ii.
of <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, and is
referred to in a footnote to Southey’s
<i>Thalaba the Destroyer</i> (p. 108, ed. 1814):—</p>

<p>In the year 1058 a young man of noble
birth had been married in Rome, and during
the period of his nuptial feast, having gone
with his companions to play at ball, he put
his marriage ring on the finger of a broken
statue of Venus in the area, to remain while
he was engaged in recreation. Desisting
from the exercise, he found the finger on
which he had put his ring contracted firmly
against the palm, and attempted in vain
either to break or disengage the ring. He
concealed the circumstances from his companions,
and returned at night with a
servant, when he found the finger extended
and the ring gone. He dissembled the
loss and returned to his wife; but when
he attempted to embrace her he found
himself prevented by something dark and
dense, which was tangible if not visible,
interposing between them; and he heard
a voice saying: “Embrace me! for I am
Venus, whom this day you wedded, and I
will not restore your ring.” As this was
constantly repeated, he consulted his relatives,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
who had recourse to Palumbus, the
priest, skilled in necromancy. He directed
the young man to go at a certain hour of
the night to a spot among the ruins of
ancient Rome where four roads meet, and
wait silently till he saw a company pass
by, and then, without uttering a word, to
deliver a letter which he gave him to a
majestic being who rode in a chariot after
the rest of the company. The young man
did as he was directed, and saw the company
of all ages, classes and ranks, on horse and
on foot, some joyful and others sad, pass
along; among whom he distinguished a
woman in a meretricious dress, who, from
the tenuity of her garments, seemed almost
naked. She rode on a mule; her long hair,
which flowed over her shoulders, was bound
with a golden fillet; and in her hand was a
golden rod with which she directed her
mule. In the close of the procession a
tall, majestic figure appeared in a chariot
adorned with emeralds and pearls, who
fiercely asked the young man what he did
there. He presented the letter in silence,
which the demon dared not refuse. As
soon as he had read, lifting up his hands to
heaven, he exclaimed: “Almighty God!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
how long wilt Thou endure the iniquities
of the sorcerer Palumbus!” and immediately
despatched some of his attendants,
who, with much difficulty, extorted the
ring from Venus and restored it to its
owner, whose infernal banns were thus
dissolved. This legend was made the
foundation of Liddell’s poem, <i>The Vampire
Bride</i>.</p>

<p>Dion Boucicault wrote and produced a
vampire play entitled <i>The Phantom</i>, the
scene of which was laid in the ruins of Raby
Castle. Anyone remaining in these ruins
for one night met with certain death before
the morning. The only sign of violence
to be found was a wound on the right side
of the throat, but no blood was to be seen.
The face of the victim was white and the
gaze fixed, as though the person had died
from fright.</p>

<p>In April 1819 a story entitled “The
Vampyre” appeared in <i>Colburn’s New
Monthly Magazine</i>, which was attributed
to Lord Byron, but which was really from
the pen of Dr John William Polidori (uncle
of William Michael Rossetti), who was for
a time Lord Byron’s travelling physician.
The work was also published separately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
but the authorship was denied by Lord
Byron. Polidori immediately claimed responsibility
for the work, and the correspondence
and statement of facts published
in Rossetti’s <i>Diary of Doctor John William
Polydori</i> show how the mistake occurred.</p>

<p>The following poem appears in the <i>Life
of James Clerk Maxwell</i>, by Lewis Campbell
and William Garnett, and was written
by Maxwell in 1845, when he was fourteen
years of age:—</p>

<p>Mr Reginald Hodder, in <i>The Vampire</i>
(William Rider &amp; Son, Ltd.), has developed
a theory which is a novel one in the annals
of vampirism. The principal character is a
living woman, a member of a secret sisterhood,
who is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire
to prevent loss of vitality. This power,
however, is exercised through the medium of
a metallic talisman, and the main thread of
the story turns on the struggle for the possession
of this talisman. It is wrested ultimately
from the hands of those who would use it for
malignant purposes, but its recovery is only
accomplished by means of a number of
extraordinary—though who would dare say
impossible?—occult phenomena.</p>

<span class="smaller">FACT OR FICTION?</span></h2>

</div>

<p>While some writers, belonging mainly to
what is popularly known as the orthodox
school of theology or professing a materialistic
philosophy, have expressed an entire
disbelief in the alleged phenomena, others,
on the other hand, accepting generally the
spiritistic or spiritualistic philosophy, have
admitted the possibility of the phenomena,
though not pledging their acceptance of all
or any of the many stories told concerning
the deeds, or rather the misdeeds, of the
apparitions.</p>

<p>Dr Pierart, the well-known French <i>savant</i>,
maintained that “the facts of vampirism are
as well attested by inquiries made as are
the facts of catalepsy,” and that “the facts
of vampirism are as old as the world,” and
pointed to the fact that Tertullian and
St Augustine spoke of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>Gabriele D’Annunzio was another firm
believer in their existence. In his <i>Triumph
of Death</i>, translated by Georgina Harding,
we read: “What have they not done?
Candia told of all the different means they
had tried, all the exorcisms they had
resorted to. The priest had come and,
after covering the child’s head with the
end of his stole, had repeated verses from
the Gospel. The mother had hung up a
wax cross, blessed on Ascension Day, over a
door, and had sprinkled the hinges with holy
water and repeated the Creed three times
in a loud voice; she had tied up a handful
of salt in a piece of linen and hung it round
the neck of her dying child. The father
had ‘done the seven nights’—that is, for
seven nights he had waited in the dark
behind a lighted lantern, attentive to the
slightest sound, ready to catch and grapple
with the vampire. A single prick with
the pin sufficed to make her visible to the
human eye. But the seven nights’ watch
had been fruitless, for the child wasted away
and grew more hopelessly feeble from hour
to hour. At last, in despair, the father had
consulted with a wizard, by whose advice
he had called a dog and put the body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
behind the door. The vampire could not
then enter the house till she counted every
hair on its body.”</p>

<p>Calmet’s explanation of the spectres so
much talked of in Hungary, Moravia,
Poland, and elsewhere is that they are
nothing but persons that are still alive in
their graves, though without motion or
respiration; and that the freshness and
ruddy colour of their blood, the flexibility
of their limbs, and their crying out when
their hearts were run through with a stick,
or their heads cut off, were demonstrative
proofs of their being still alive. “But
this,” he says, “does not affect the principal
difficulty at which I stick, namely, how they
come out of and go into their graves,
without leaving any mark of the earth’s
being removed; and how they appear to
carry former clothes. If they are not really
dead, why do they return to their graves
again and not stay in the land of the living?
Why do they suck the blood of their
relations, and torment and pester persons
that should naturally be true to them and
never give them any offence? On the other
hand, if it be nothing but a mere whim of
the persons infested, whence comes it that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
these carcases are found in their graves
uncorrupted, full of blood, with their limbs
pliant and flexible, and their feet dirty, the
next day after they have been patrolling
about and frightening the neighbourhood,
whilst nothing of this sort can be discovered
in other carcases that were buried
at the same time and in the same mound?
Whence is it that they come no more after
they are burned or impaled?”</p>

<p>Other writers have accepted the theory
that the subjects are not really dead, but
are only in a death-like condition. The
Germans express this condition of apparent
death and of the perfect preservation of
the living body by the term <i>scheintod</i>,
which is, perhaps, better than the English
term “suspended animation.” Dr Herbert
Mayo describes the special condition of
vampires as a “death-trance”—a positive
status, a period of repose, the duration of
which is sometimes definite and predetermined,
though unknown, and says that the
patient sometimes awakes suddenly when
the term of the death-trance has expired.
During this trance-period the action of the
heart, breathing, voluntary motion, as well
as feeling and intelligence and the vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
changes in the body, are said to be suspended.
Two instances of the death-trance
are quoted.</p>

<p>Cardinal Espinosa, prime minister under
Philip the Second of Spain, died, as it was
supposed, after a short illness. His rank
entitled him to be embalmed. Accordingly,
the body was opened for that purpose.
The lungs and heart had just been brought
into view, when the latter was seen to beat.
The cardinal, awakening at the fatal moment,
had still strength enough left to seize
with his hand the knife of the anatomist.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of September 1763, the Abbé
Prévost, the French novelist and compiler
of travels, was seized with a fit in the forest
of Chantilly. The body was found and
conveyed to the residence of the nearest
clergyman. It was supposed that death
had taken place through apoplexy. But
the local authorities, desiring to be satisfied
of the fact, ordered the body to be examined.
During the process the poor Abbé uttered
a cry of agony. It was too late.</p>

<p>Among Theosophists and Continental
spiritists a solution to the problem is
found in their teaching concerning the
astral body and the astral plane, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
conveyed by Madame Blavatsky in <i>Isis
Unveiled</i>.</p>

<p>It is held that so long as the astral
form is not entirely separated from the
body there is a liability that it may be
forced by magnetic attraction to re-enter it.
Sometimes it will be only half-way out when
the corpse, which presents the appearance
of death, is buried. In such cases the astral
body voluntarily re-enters the mortal frame,
and then one of two things happens—either
the unhappy victim will writhe in the
agonising torture of suffocation, or if he
has been grossly material he becomes a
vampire. It is held that this ethereal form
can go wherever it pleases, and that it is
possible for this astral body to feed on
human victims and carry the sustenance
to the corpus lying within the tomb by
means of an invisible cord of connection,
the nature of which is at present unknown;
but psychical researchers—and these number
many eminent scientists—have of late years
devoted their efforts towards the elucidation
of the phenomenon known as the projection
of the double; and this, if scientifically
and satisfactorily explained, will give the
clue to many of the phenomena of vampirism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>This “double” may sometimes during life
be projected unconsciously, and sometimes
purposely, by means of hypnotism or provoked
somnambulism. An example of the
former appeared in the <i>Journal du Magnétisme</i>
for October 1909, and the translation of
the account was published in the <i>Annals
of Psychical Science</i> for January-March
1910, and is here reproduced. The narrator
is M. Antonio Salazar of Mexico.</p>

<h3>“<i>A Romantic Case of Projection of the
Double</i></h3>

<p>“In 1889 I lived at Juatlahuaca, in the
state of Oaxaca, Mexico. For a long time
I passionately loved the woman who afterwards
became my wife.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of 1890, through one
of those unfortunate disagreements which
occasionally arise between parents and their
children, those of my beloved one, wishing
to put an end to our mutual love, separated
us by taking her to the mountains; but
this only increased our love, because of the
difficulties and our desire to see each other.</p>

<p>“Several months passed after our separation,
and though the distance between us
was not great, we had to take into account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the vigilance with which she was surrounded,
and which was a greater obstacle than the
difficulties of the road.</p>

<p>“One night, when I was feeling, as usual,
very sad and gloomy, the thought came to
me to say to my servant: ‘Jeanette, if
any morning you come into my room and
do not find me, do not look for me; take the
keys and open the shop. If at midday I
have not arrived, you can seek for me in
the mountains.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, sir,’ she replied, ‘I would never
oppose myself to your commands, if what
you tell me did not concern persons whom
I love and respect, because you will never
thereby accomplish your object.’</p>

<p>“I knew that she was right, and I thought
that the best thing I could do was to go to
sleep and try to calm my imagination.
She also retired, much distressed, and imploring
all the saints, to whom she prayed,
to prevent any unfortunate incident which
would threaten the lives of three persons—my
<i>fiancée</i>, her father, and myself.</p>

<p>“The following day I awoke with the
same project in my mind, but before carrying
it out I wished to inform my <i>fiancée</i> as to
the day and hour at which I hoped to speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
to her. She replied by showing me the
rashness of my project, and offering to do
all she could to overcome the obstacles
which prevented her from returning to live
in the town, which she hoped to do in a
few days, and which came to pass as she
had predicted. I reckoned, however, on
my sagacity and youthful ardour to realise
my project before my <i>fiancée</i> was able to
return.</p>

<p>“One day, when my mind was indulging
itself in all kinds of fancies, I thought it
would be quite easy to elude the vigilance
of all those who were around my <i>fiancée</i>,
and who were opposed to our meeting.
When night came on I continued to think of
my project, and I resolved to lie down and
try to sleep.</p>

<p>“I passed a very disturbed night, waking
frequently, and when the day began to
break, the servant came to my room to bid
me ‘good morning,’ and to ask for the
keys of the shop.</p>

<p>“‘How have you passed the night, sir?’
she asked.</p>

<p>“‘Rather badly, Jeanette. I have
dreamed continually, and it is impossible
for me to give you an idea of all the dangers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
and precipices which I thought I overcame
and crossed; it seems to me that I went
over the mountain road which leads to the
farm, but it was a very different road. I
dreamed that our interview was prevented,
I do not know how, and that I had a long
walk home again. What can it all mean?’</p>

<p>“‘It is only the result of your wishes
and preoccupation in regard to the young
lady. She will soon return, and then
these follies will disappear.’</p>

<p>“I very soon forgot all about what I have
just described, and so did my servant, for
neither of us attached any importance to a
dream; but, after a short time, a messenger
from the farm handed me a letter, in which
my <i>fiancée</i> reproached me for my violence,
my bad conduct and disobedience in going
there in defiance of the commands and
wishes of her father.</p>

<p>“‘What? I? No. Never! Tell your
mistress that, although I have thought of
going to see her, I have never carried out
my desires; if I have not done so, it has
not been through lack of courage and will
on my part, but only because of my desire
to please her and not to oppose her wishes.’</p>

<p>“‘But we saw you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“‘Me?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir—you.’</p>

<p>“‘You are telling an untruth. I have
not been out. My servant can corroborate
that; and, further, I have nothing to lose
by telling the truth.’</p>

<p>“‘That may be as you please, but it is
true that you spoke to me; you questioned
me on the subject of Mademoiselle—desired
me to tell her that you were there and wished
to speak to her.’</p>

<p>“‘These are illusions on your part; you
have been dreaming.’</p>

<p>“‘That is possible; but there were two,
three, all the servants, who also saw you.
You did not arrive until nearly midnight;
you were dressed as you are now, and riding
a white horse, which you fastened to the
gnarled oak. We could all recognise you
by the moonlight, and you were going towards
the side door when I stopped you
from entering.</p>

<p>“‘Hearing our voices, the dogs began to
bark, which caused all the servants to get
up. You were recognised by my master
and the young lady, who fell on her knees
before her father, beseeching him not to
fire on you. Without showing any fear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
you returned step by step to your horse
and went down the mountain again. My
master was much annoyed with you, called
his confidential servant Marino, ordered
him to follow you and not to be afraid, but
to fire on you two or three times, as he
would be responsible. Marino set out, and,
although he walked quickly and tried all
he could to catch you up, he could not do
so. A curious phenomenon aroused his
attention, which was that he always saw
you going at the same pace, and he had not
the courage to fire his rifle.</p>

<p>“‘You arrived at the entrance to the
town about five o’clock in the morning; the
moon was setting and the day commencing
to break. Before you arrived at the first
crossing of the streets you began to run,
and turned quickly along the first street
in the town; and though Marino ran after
you, he lost sight of you at the next
crossing.’</p>

<p>“My persecutor, frightened by what he
had seen, returned immediately to the farm
to inform his master of what had taken
place, and which seemed very extraordinary
and supernormal.</p>

<p>“For a long time this adventure, of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
I was the unconscious hero, made a great
stir in the town.”</p>

<p>Colonel de Rochas, a distinguished French
savant, has made this question of the externalisation
or projection of the double
and of the motricity and sensibility of
the subject his special and patient study,
and has embodied the results of many of
his experiments in separate works. Some
have also been published in the pages of
the <i>Annals of Psychical Science</i>, so that
the reader who is particularly interested in
the question will have no difficulty in finding
material for further consideration and study.</p>

<p>The Société Magnétique de France has
also conducted extensive experiments in
this field of research, particulars of which
are published from time to time in the
<i>Journal du Magnétisme</i>. The following
theoretical explanation given at the conclusion
of the report of a series of these
experiments is reprinted from the <i>Annals</i>
for July-September 1910:—</p>

<p>“We know that the phantom is the
psychical body projected from the physical
body. It is that which enjoys or suffers,
thinks, wishes, judges, and perceives all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
sensations. It is constantly animated by
extremely rapid vibratory movements
which are certainly the same as when it
is within the body. This principle being
admitted, we understand that, when it
animates the body, its vibratory movements
are not projected outside, and that it
exercises no appreciable action on other
organisms in its neighbourhood. But when
it is outside the body its movements are
easily externalised. Then the phantom and
another person, vibrating in unison, represent
two stringed instruments which
sound at the same time when one only is
touched. If I can obtain this transmission
at great distances, we can explain this
strange and unexpected phenomenon by the
theory of wireless telegraphy or telephony.”</p>

<p>The results of the many experiments
conducted by and under the auspices of
French scientists in particular tend to
indicate that in the near future an explanation
of the phenomena of vampirism will be
forthcoming.</p>

<p>“The story is really exciting, and the ordinary reader who merely
wishes to be thrilled will gain his desire and find Mr Hodder’s
pages most engrossing. To occultists the author presents a new
theory and a novel treatment of an ancient subject, both of which
merit their attention and consideration.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“Readers who enjoy fierce mystery of the supernatural order will
discover a most thrilling experience in ‘The Vampire.’”—<i>Glasgow
Herald.</i></p>

<p>“For the first few pages we attempted to employ a critical mind,
but the narrative soon held us in a grip of terror, and we could do
no more than sit at the author’s feet and abandon ourselves to fearful
joy.”—<i>The Standard.</i></p>

<p>“Horror succeeds horror, and mystery is piled upon mystery. It
is a blood-curdling, hair-raising story of the black art and of evil
spirits.”—<i>Sheffield Independent.</i></p>

<p>“It is one of the most sensationally weird stories ever written—a
marvellous excursion into the realms of the occult.”—<i>Hampshire
Independent.</i></p>

<p>“An astounding story.”—<i>The New Statesman.</i></p>

<p>“Mr Hodder’s story is full of thrills and uncanny excitements....
As thrilling an experience as one could wish for in the pages
of fiction.”—<i>The Globe.</i></p>

<p>“Those who enjoy grim fantasies such as the late Mr Bram
Stoker used to give us will appreciate Mr Hodder’s clever essay in
the same class of fiction.... Events move so quickly and are so
startling that there is little inclination for criticism.”—<i>Western

<p>“These letters are really ‘the letters of a traveller in a strange
country. They record his impressions, often his mistakes, sometimes
perhaps his provincial prejudices; but at least they are not a
re-hash of what somebody else has said.’ It is obvious that the
writer took over with him to the other side the keen intelligence of
an investigator as well as the impartiality of a judicial mind, which
his occupation on earth had been the best means of cultivating. I
question if the same can be said of any previous communication
from the other world, and it is this very fact that renders ‘Letters
from a Living Dead Man’ so original and supremely absorbing.
Compared with it, all previous records seem trivial and commonplace.”—<span class="smcap">Ralph
Shirley</span> in the <i>Occult Review</i>.</p>

<p>“Of all the communications we have seen purporting to come
from beyond the veil, these are quite the most entertaining and from
the hypothesis of their authenticity some of the most instructive.
They give a vivid glimpse into life on the other side and some idea
of the laws of nature on that plane.... With all their romance
they are a quite serious contribution to the life beyond death.”—<i>The
